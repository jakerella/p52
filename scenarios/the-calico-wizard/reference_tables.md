### Character Races

The **Miowethian** people are furrier than most and a bit smaller of a race, but with keen eyesight and very good balance. They are smart, but somewhat untrustworthy, both by other races and within their own ranks. The Avanti and Escurielle in particular tend to fear and distrust these people.

**Wufanthians** are highly trusted by most, except for the Miowethian. They aren't too big, not too small, and have moderate strength. Good all around guides, if a bit clumsy. Their humor tends to set them apart from others as well.

Some of the fastest people around are the **Avanti**, but that speed comes at a price with strength. They can be quite smart, but few other races ever listen to what they have to say.

The **Urson** are the largest of the peoples in this world, hulking masses that can move any object with ease. Despite their great mass, they can also move quite fast - when needed.

The most agile of peoples are the **Escurielle**, able to easily balance on the tip of pole. They are quick, and if you aren't careful, they can easily run circles around you, taking what they will. They are also the most mischievous of peoples.

Possibly the smartest - and sneakiest - of peoples are the **Racuu**. They are often caught doing things the other peoples of this world question. That said, their ability to manipulate the world around them is unmatched.

Of all the peoples of this world, the **Otorani** are the most trusted and most charismatic. These people tend to be diplomats and leaders of others, even outside their own race. They are smart, but generally use their guile and memory to manipulate others.

#### Race Abilities

This scenario does not impart any default abilities for specific races.

### Character Classes

Your character has been training their whole life for adventures like this. Choose from the table below what their focus has been, and then attain the abilities of that class!

#### Class Modifiers

|  Race   | Lift | Think | Balance | Move | Lead |
| ------- |:----:|:-----:|:-------:|:----:|:----:|
| Fighter | +2   | 0     | -1      | 0    | +1   |

| Captain | +1   | -1    | -1      | +1   | +2   |

#### Race Abilities

In addition to the core ability modifiers above, characters will start with these abilities at level 1, ignoring any pre-requisites:

* Fighter: Sword, Body Block
* Rogue: Bow, Lock Picking, Dodge
* Wizard: Fire Ball, Scholar, Counter Spell
* Cleric: Heal, Grapple, Dodge
* Captain: Knife, Threaten, Body Block


### Abilities

There are various shorthands used in the table below:

* Core abilities are shortened in the "Pre-req" and "Damage" columns: (**Lt** (Lift), **Th** (Think), **Bc** (Balance), **Mv** (Move), and **Ld** (Lead))
* "aLv" refers to the character's current level in this ability
* "avgLv" refers to the average level of all characters in your party
* "I" is shorthand for "Item", and generally means a value that comes from the equipped item (if relevant)
* "Over" refers to the value over the target flipped/attained for any ability use
* A "#" sign indicates the number of targets present for the current action
* An "F" indicates you must flip an Action card to determine that value

> Also note that the "Exp" column represents the amount of experience required to attain the next level in that ability. However, this number is **always multiplied by the character's current level in that ability**. In other words, going from level 3 to level 4 in Bow requires (3 x 6) = 18 experience points.

### Example Quirks

You absolutely do _not_ have to use these, but they are good representative examples of quirks that work within the game mechanics!

| Quirk | Penalty | Bonus | Description |
| ----- | ------- | ----- | ----------- |
| Scared of magic | +2 target for defense against magic | -2 target to hit magical enemies | You're very scared of magic, and panic around it, which causes you to be bad at defending yourself. That said, you hate it so much, that you're really good at hitting magical targets with your weapon. |
| Scared of the dark | +1 target to hit in room with dark areas | +1 Movement in room with dark areas | You just really want to get this over with and get back to the light. |
| Controlling personality | +2 to target on any enemy YOU don't attack first | +4 Initiative and +AvgLv damage to targets you DO attack first | It's not that you have to do everything, it's that everything has to be done the way you want. |
| Blood thirsty | -1 x AvgLv exp points per enemy YOU don't kill | +2 exp per enemy defeated | I just like to kill things, so what? |
| Sorcerer's apprentice | -AvgLv to effect of any magic ability | -5 exp points to Level up magic abilities | One day you'll learn all their tricks... then you'll show 'em. |
| Can't sit still | Must move every 3 turns or they lose the next turn | Once per space, may take 3 turns at once | Look, I don't know how you can all just _sit_ there and talk away when there's so much cool stuff to do and did you see that chest over there I bet it has some awesome loot let's check it hey where are you going was I talking too fast? |
| Magical Tourette's Syndrome | Cast magic uncontrollably | Cast magic uncontrollably | Any turn that you don't attack (when enemies are present), flip a card: on 4 or less you cast a magic attack uncontrollably. If the card is red, it's Fire Ball, if black, then it's Ice Storm. The attack always targets the nearest enemy, even if that's the same spot you are on. Flip another card for the attack on the target as normal. If you are not trained in the spell, assume a level of 1 in that ability. If on your first flip (to determine if the effect happens) you flip a King, you get a free attack of the same type (red or black deciding which type) on a target of your choice. |

### All Items

These are the items you can find in chests or from enemy drops for this scenario and any of the quests in it. If you are asked to **flip for an item**, flip 2 cards, then use the table below to see what you have found. Use the **total sum** of the two cards and their **suit colors** to determine your loot. Note that a color of "red" or "black" means _both_ cards match in color. The term "mixed" indicates one red and one black card on your flip for the item.

> The "Requirements" specified below are only to _use_ (or equip) the item. Anyone may carry any item.
> 
> While there is no limit to the items you can carry, the weight of **equipped** items may impede your movement! Refer to the [Chests and Items section](../../rules/07_chests_and_items.md#item-weight) of the rules for details. (All weights below are _per item_, so if an item is a multiple (like the torches), the weight is for each item.)

Various abbreviations and shorthands are used in the table below:

* Core abilities are shortened to: (**Lt** (Lift), **Th** (Think), **Bc** (Balance), **Mv** (Move), and **Ld** (Lead))
* "dmg" refers to Damage done to an enemy (note that negative "HP" is damage done to the player character)
* "T" is short for "Target", the value you need to achieve to successfully use an ability
* "aLv" refers to the character's current level in a referenced ability
* "Lv" refers to the level of the character using or consuming the item
* "avgLv" refers to the average level of all characters in your party
* A "#" sign indicates the number of targets for an action
* An "F" indicates you must flip an Action card to determine that value

|     2      | _mixed_   | Nothing                |              |    -    |               | Huh, you were sure there was something here. Oh well. |

> † Item weights only apply to equipped items! Non-equipped item weights included in case players are using advanced rule for restricting total item carrying capacity  
> ~ Item is consumed by using it, remove it from your inventory  
> \* Must be equipped to gain effect; note that all armor effects are _passive_ (no need to take an action to receive benefit)  
> ‡ Item **may not** be thrown unless some other rule is in play (or rather, if you do throw it, the item will be destroyed on impact)

#### Additional Item Details

If your Movement is 0 or less by the **weight of your equipped gear** then you will not be able to move! However, as much _unequipped_ gear can be carried as you like. (Unless playing with the alternate carrying rule.)

All **Armor** can be worn by any character, and multiple armor pieces can be worn around the body, but never two pieces on the same body part (head, torso, arms, legs). The effects of any (and all) armor is cumulative, so if you are wearing the full set of Leather armor (cap, greaves, jacket, bracers), then you have -4 passive damage protection. This means that if you are attacked and hit for damage of 12, and do not otherwise defend, then you only lose 8 hit points.

**Dragon's Blood** and **Phoenix Feather** will only work on players in the space, thus you cannot bring a dead party member back to life once you leave them behind in a space. (And you cannot carry a character with you.)

The **Winged Boots** are a special item which allows all the wearer to move and take another action in the same turn (in any order), but player's cannot split this up. For example, after equipping this item, a player with a movement of 3 could move one spot and then attack an enemy, but they may not then move another two spots.

The **Invisibility Cloak** can only be used once per space (but it does not need to be equipped) and lasts for 3 rounds – a round includes one full cycle of turns. Using the cloak consumes the first turn, and you become invisible until the **end of your turn, 3 turns later**. In other words, you get 3 full turns of being invisible and taking actions. After the player's third turn being invisible, the cloak's effect will wear off. After this it remains in your inventory, but unable to be used until the next space. While the cloak is active (during the three rounds) enemies cannot see you (and thus cannot attack you). This includes enemies that would otherwise attempt a passing attack as you move through their spot. The player can attack while cloaked, this does not alter the enemies perception, and they still cannot attack you, including counter attacks! Your **melee attacks may not be defended**, but ranged attacks may be defended by an enemy, as they would see the projectile coming in. Players that are cloaked _can_ be injured by effects on a spot (versus single enemy) like Fire Ball.

When you find a **companion**, you must first describe what creature you have found (remember, this is still a role playing game)! The creature must be able to fit in a large chest (so no elephants). This companion has imprinted on you, and is loyal only to you, and thus can never be traded and will never leave. The companion will attack any enemy you attack, and since the enemy will be defending _your_ attack, it will not see the companion coming, thus companions always deal `+Lv` damage to an enemy you attack, regardless of the outcome of your attack. Additionally, the companion will distract attacking enemies, making their attack target always a +1 against you. If you receive a new companion, you may keep the current one with and take an additional +1 damage to the companion attack, or describe a new companion. If you take on a new companion, the old one will be jealous and run away forever. The new companion will receive the additional +1 damage bonus. If you die, your companion leaves, regardless of whether you get revived (even immediately by a Phoenix Feather).


### Enemies

These are the enemies that may appear in this scenario. Refer to the [Enemy Turns section](../../rules/08_enemy_turns.md) of the rules for how they will behave.

* The following abbreviations are used in the enemies table:
    - "L" is the **average level** of all characters
    - "O" is the amount Over the Target for the enemy attack
    - "R" is the range from the enemy to the player being attacked
    - "Init" is the enemy's initiative
    - "M" is the enemy's movement
* If any enemy's Movement is `0`, then they cannot move at all, even to retreat.
* Each enemy may have a Melee and a Ranged attack (or blank if they cannot attack in that way). The format is always `| type; target; damage |` in the table, for example, `| Knife; 10-L; (Lx2)+O |`
* An enemy with a ranged attack will _always_ use that if in range of a player character!
* Each enemy will have 3 defense modifiers labelled "D-Me" for melee attacks, "D-Mg" for magic attacks, and "D-Rg" for non-magic ranged attacks. A "-1" means their target to defend is one less, thus more likely. A "+1" means their target to defend is one greater, thus less likely.

#### Goblins (Jacks)

Goblins are small creatures that generally fear direct contact with other species. Their diminutive stature makes them very good at hiding and climbing, preferring to find a good out of the way spot to fire arrows than directly attacking their opponents. Only found in the mountainous regions, this race of creature is highly impressionable and easily controlled. The goblins your party encounters all appear to be working under a guiding hand.

> \* The **Diamond Goblin** will attack a second time if their first attack fails to deal any damage. They cannot perform a melee attack, but will retreat.

#### Miowethians (Queens)

These people look like normal Miowethians, but with a glazed over look in their eyes. They've clearly been ensnared by some great force. As with most of their kind, they are smart and athletic. The Miowethians you encounter on this journey seem to have a glow about them, clearly imbued with some magical powers.

> A Miowethian's magic range is 2-5 spots. A Miowethian's Staff and Pike range is 0-1 spots.

> \* If the **Heart Miowethian's** ice magic is not successfully defended, the player is frozen and loses their next turn.  
> † If the **Diamond Miowethian's** attack hits, regardless of the defense, the player is moved one space away from the enemy, if possible.

#### Wufanthians (Kings)

It is rare to see a **Wufanthian** and Miowethian working together. The gruff, brutes are well adapted to close combat and rarely shy away from a fight. These people, much like the Miowethians around here, seem to be enchanted, which might account for their above average skill and strength.

> A Wufanthian's Pike has range 0-1 and bow has range 2-4, but the Sword has no range (must be on the same spot).

> \* A Wufanthian with a bow will **only fire once** between moves. In other words, they might fire at a player, move, then fire their bow again if not yet in melee range. They will never fire their bow on two consecutive turns.
