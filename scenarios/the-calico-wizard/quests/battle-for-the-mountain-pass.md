### Introduction

As your party gathers outside of the exit from the ancient castle Purlion a raven appears and lands on a large boulder near you. It caws twice, then begins to speak in a crackled, yet strong voice. "Well done, my heroes! Few have ever gotten this far in our time." The raven caws a few more times before continuing, looking around at your party. It can't actually recognize you, can it?

"Now you must continue up the mountain. My ravens have seen the glow of great magic near the summit. We believe the old wizard, Calico, may have the amulet! We cannot allow him to control its power."

Your party finally feels they are on the cusp of recovering the amulet. The path up the mountain, while no doubt treacherous, is clearly laid out in front of them. It is time to press on!

The raven begins to flap its wings to fly away and says, "these may help you continue your quest."

A flurry of ravens arrives as the first disappears down the mountain. Each one carrying a parcel, one for each character.

### Quest Rules

The first space will be decided at random by flipping per the normal [space layout rules](../../rules/05_space_layout.md). The first space will always be exterior and daytime.

Once players make it through the first space, they will generate and enter another space, but **only flip 1 card** to determine the size of the space. This space will be interior and **fully lit**, that is, **all spots will be revealed**, even if out of line of sight of the characters. As such, **all enemies are immediately revealed** and aware of your party.

The exit to the second space is blocked, you must kill all enemies to unblock it. **As soon as the last enemy is killed** the exit is unblocked; however, your party sees that the space is actually larger!

**Immediately** award experience, level up if necessary, and **reshuffle the Enemy deck**. **DO NOT** alter the current space layout!

Now flip 1 Action card to determine the additional size of the space. Lay out these cards per normal rules, starting from the exit to the previous space. In other words, increase the size of the current space (versus layout out a new space). The exit for this **new** space will be randomly determined per the usual rules. As before, all spots are **revealed immediately**, along with any enemies.

In addition to the new enemies, any **two's or three's** from the previously revealed space **_respawn_ as new enemies**!

Perform this expansion twice more. In other words, there are three total expansions, plus the original space - so four total spaces in the quest.

**Remember to reshuffle the Enemy deck between each expansion!**

Once that last expansion is complete, and **all enemies are defeated**, your party can make their way to the now unblocked exit. Note that [the "delay" rule](../../rules/09_leaving_a_space.md#delaying-your-exit) still applies!

* Any Ace is a normal chest
* Any two is an enemy, and respawns for each wave
* Any three is an enemy, and respawns for each wave

---

### Proceed

See the Quest Rules (previous section) for the layout specifics. You will need to survive four waves of enemies!

Your quest is complete after exiting the fourth space (the final expansion).

### Conclusion

You are able to defeat the last few enemies that were blocking the way and continue up the mountainside. It's been a tough battle, but you prevailed. You noticed a number of ravens circling overhead at various points during the skirmish and assume that the Queen has been watching. She'll be aware that you are nearing the summit now. You can even start to see the faint orange glow the Queen spoke of.

**Do you have the Queen's Favor coin?**

<!-- CHOICE ["We have the coin", "We have no such coin"] -->

---

<!-- OPTION "We have no such coin" -->

One of your party remarks how this may have been easier if you had re-equipped back at the Queen's castle before getting this far.

Oh well.

---

<!-- OPTION "We have the coin" -->

**DO NOT READ** this section if you don't have the Queen's Favor coin, it contains **SPOILERS!!**

As you all rest and recover, you pull out the coin you received from the Queen and turn it over in your hand. It glints in the sun and you hear a loud caw from above. You look up expecting to see a raven, but instead it is a mighty eagle. The eagle glides down and lands only a few yards away, cocks its head while looking at you, then looks at the coin.

This is obviously not a normal eagle, and it clearly is interested in the coin. You flip the coin in the air and catch it again. The eagle watches it flip through the air. You don't know exactly why you think this might work, but you flip the coin in the direction of the eagle.

With a swoop of one wing, the eagle envelopes the coin, spins rapidly, and begins to morph. Startled, the entire party braces for what may come next. In a matter of seconds the eagle transforms into a small chest with the Queen's emblem on the front. The party relaxes. "Did you all know she was that powerful?" the previous owner of the coin asks.

Inside the chest you find a scroll and a pouch. The pouch has a reviving potion and an ice elixir in it. The scroll appears to be instructions for a particular spell.

**The character who held the coin** may choose any character (including themselves) to use the scroll to learn a **new magical ability**. They _do not_ have to meet the pre-requisites to acquire this new ability, but they must meet the requirements to _use_ the ability when the time comes.
