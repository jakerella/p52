## An Intriguing Proposition

The shrouded woman in the tavern explains that she has a mission for your group, direct from the Queen. She applauds your recent work in Wufanthia, having heard of your triumph over the goblins that had infested the sewers under their capitol city. The praise was clearly meant to stroke your egos, but you don't mind so much. She then describes the recent attacks and says that the Queen believes the creatures are trying to find the Scarlet Amulet of Lasoor.

Thought lost to time over a hundred years ago, the amulet is said to have great power, giving those who possess it unmatched magical prowess. The Queen has had visions of the amulet in her dreams, being held by a withered hand on a makeshift throne. The dream, she admits, could be the present or the future, but regardless, she needs you to find the amulet and return it safely to the castle. Of course, you will be rewarded handsomely upon success.

You will start this quest outside, in the forest leading to the mountain, and then into one of the lower caves where the eerie glow was first noticed.

### Quest Rules

The first 2 spaces will be exterior, in the forest. You may begin at any time of day you wish (or flip to randomize it). Don't forget that the time of day (or night) will change in the second space! The third space will be the cave, and it will be **dark**, be sure you have something to light the way!

The amulet may be in one of many hidden chests in the caverns (it will not appear in the forest), your party should start their search there.

* An Ace in the forest is a simple chest (no chance for the amulet)
* An Ace in a cavernous room is a special chest and an **enemy is always defending it** (so draw one for this spot).
    - After successfully opening the chest (just like normal), you must see if what you seek is in it: flip one card from the Action deck, if the card is 6 or lower this chest only contains a normal item (flip as you would normally).
    - If the flip is a 7 or greater, **you have found the amulet case**!
* A two of hearts or diamonds is a double enemy
* A two of spades or clubs is a hidden spot
* A three is always a spike pit
    - when revealed, if the player is _adjacent_ to the pit, they fall in
    - flip an action card: on a 4 or less, you take avgLv damage from the spikes
    - Regardless of your flip, you lose your next turn climbing out (you are now on the pit spot)
    - Any character entering this spot for any reason will fall and must flip and lose a turn
    - Enemies will avoid this spot as if it were blocked

### Starting Items

Before starting your quest, each player should receive 1 healing potion and 1 [random starting item](reference_tables.md#starting-items).

### PAUSE HERE AND PLAY YOUR QUEST!

---

Sadly, the case was empty. Inside of it is strange script that you can't understand, and on the underside you notice scratches that look like claw marks. The case was clearly pried open and the amulet taken. Your party must decide: do they return to the Queen with an empty case and tell her what you've found? Or do they press on into the mountain to search for the amulet itself?

### Quest Bonuses

Regardless of your choice, this is the end of the current quest (and game session). Each character receives [standard quest experience](../../rules/10_experience_and_leveling.md), then read your chosen option below!

#### **If you choose to return...**

The Queen is disappointed that the amulet was not in its case, but she understands. She applauds your bravery and ability to persevere where others have failed. Your dedication is inspiring. That said, you _did not_ return the amulet, and thus she cannot reward you in full yet. She hopes you will continue the mission soon.

* All characters receive `(3 x Level)` experience
* The character with the lowest current HP receives 1 healing potion (only 1 available, so pick who gets it if tied)
* All characters are fully healed (and dead players may be resurrected)
* All characters receive 1 lock pick item
* All characters receive 1 piece of "leather armor" (see items table) from the Queen's armory
    - Each player decides what body part it fits on (but once decided, you cannot change it!)
* The character currently holding the amulet case receives a coin representing the Queen's favor

#### **If you choose to press on...**

You send a raven back to the castle to provide word of your progress and that your party will press on. Your party was unfamiliar with this terrain and these beasts at first, but now you feel you have the experience to 

* All characters receive `(4 x Level)` experience
* The character with the lowest current HP is fully healed
* All other characters heal to 90% `(max HP * 0.9)` (those already above 90% do not change)
* Each character finds 1 torch in the cave
* The character who opened the most chests finds 1 lock pick (if tied, all tied players get one)
* The character with the most kills (regardless of who else attacked) finds the golden claw (knife) on a dead enemy
    - If tied, party decides who gets it
    - Damage when using Knife (or knife throw) ability: `(Knife Ability Level x 3)`
    - If thrown, target to hit is reduced by -1
    - If thrown, automatically returned to characters if any other character enters the spot with the thrown claw
