The land of Mioweth has been at peace for over two hundred years. Their people are simple, but practical folk, living in mostly stone dwellings and primarily focused on agriculture. They have been trading more and more with outside groups, but they still produce most of their own food and clothing. Of course, with trade comes interaction with other peoples, and other skills.

Mioweth has recently seen numerous attacks in the outlying villages by terrible beasts, especially the villages in the foothills of the Lichanden mountains. The mountains have long been seen as a possible source of evil, with stories going back hundreds of years. Not too long ago, sentries in the forests observed a strange glow emanating from caves up the mountain side.

Fearing for her people, the Queen of Mioweth, Katya, sent a contingent of soldiers to investigate. They were never heard from again! Now, her forces fear any excursion that even comes close to the mountain. But something must be done!

After returning from a voyage to distant Wufanthia, you and your mates decided to rest up at the inn above the tavern in Tabantha, one of the small outlying villages. It was in this tavern that you were approached by a strange woman, shrouding her identity with a heavy cloak and partial mask. As soon as she approached your table, everyone else in the tavern seemed to move much more slowly, and completely ignored her presence.

"Why the mask?" You ask her casually. "Were you horribly scarred or something?"

"No," she answers, "I just find them terribly comfortable. I think everyone will be wearing them soon. But that's not why I'm here."

---

## First Quest

The shrouded woman in the tavern explains that she has a mission for your group, direct from the Queen. She applauds your recent work in Wufanthia, having heard of your triumph over the goblins that had infested the sewers under their capitol city. The praise was clearly meant to stroke your egos, but you don't mind so much. She then describes the recent attacks and says that the Queen believes the creatures are trying to find the Scarlet Amulet of Lasoor.

Thought lost to time over a hundred years ago, the amulet is said to have great power, giving those who possess it unmatched magical prowess. The Queen has had visions of the amulet in her dreams, being held by a withered hand on a makeshift throne. The dream, she admits, could be the present or the future, but regardless, she needs you to find the amulet and return it safely to the castle. Of course, you will be rewarded handsomely upon success.

You will start this quest outside, in the forest leading to the mountain, and then into one of the lower caves where the eerie glow was first noticed.

### Quest Rules

The first 2 spaces will be exterior, in the forest. You may begin at any time of day you wish (or flip to randomize it). Don't forget that the time of day (or night) will change in the second space! The third space will be the cave, and it will be **dark**, be sure you have something to light the way!

The amulet may be in one of many hidden chests in the caverns (it will not appear in the forest), your party should start their search there.

* An Ace in the forest is a simple chest (no chance for the amulet)
* An Ace in a cavernous room is a special chest and an **enemy is always defending it** (so draw one for this spot).
    - After successfully opening the chest (just like normal), you must see if what you seek is in it: flip one card from the Action deck, if the card is 6 or lower this chest only contains a normal item (flip as you would normally).
    - If the flip is a 7 or greater, **you have found the amulet case**!
* A two of hearts or diamonds is a double enemy
* A two of spades or clubs is a hidden spot
* A three is always a spike pit
    - when revealed, if the player is _adjacent_ to the pit, they fall in
    - flip an action card: on a 4 or less, you take avgLv damage from the spikes
    - Regardless of your flip, you lose your next turn climbing out (you are now on the pit spot)
    - Any character entering this spot for any reason will fall and must flip and lose a turn
    - Enemies will avoid this spot as if it were blocked

#### Starting Items

Before starting your quest, each player should receive 1 healing potion and 1 [random starting item](reference_tables.md#starting-items).

> **PAUSE HERE AND PLAY YOUR QUEST!**
> 
> (The following section is for the end of the quest!)

---

Sadly, the case was empty. Inside of it is strange script that you can't understand, and on the underside you notice scratches that look like claw marks. The case was clearly pried open and the amulet taken. Your party must decide: do they return to the Queen with an empty case and tell her what you've found? Or do they press on into the mountain to search for the amulet itself?

> **PAUSE HERE AND DECIDE BEFORE READING ON!**

---

#### Quest Bonuses

Regardless of your choice, this is the end of the current quest (and game session). Each character receives [standard quest experience](../../rules/10_experience_and_leveling.md), then read your chosen option below!


#### **If you choose to return...**

The Queen is disappointed that the amulet was not in its case, but she understands. She applauds your bravery and ability to persevere where others have failed. Your dedication is inspiring. That said, you _did not_ return the amulet, and thus she cannot reward you in full yet. She hopes you will continue the mission soon.

* All characters receive `(3 x Level)` experience
* The character with the lowest current HP receives 1 healing potion (only 1 available, so pick who gets it if tied)
* All characters are fully healed (and dead players may be resurrected)
* All characters receive 1 lock pick item
* All characters receive 1 piece of "good armor" (see items table) from the Queen's armory
    - Each player decides what body part it fits on (but once decided, you cannot change it!)
* The character currently holding the amulet case receives a coin representing the Queen's favor

#### **If you choose to press on...**

You send a raven back to the castle to provide word of your progress and that your party will press on. Your party was unfamiliar with this terrain and these beasts at first, but now you feel you have the experience to 

* All characters receive `(4 x Level)` experience
* The character with the lowest current HP is fully healed
* All other characters heal to 90% `(max HP * 0.9)` (those already above 90% do not change)
* Each character finds 1 torch in the cave
* The character who opened the most chests finds 1 lock pick (if tied, all tied players get one)
* The character with the most kills (regardless of who else attacked) finds the golden claw (knife) on a dead enemy
    - If tied, party decides who gets it
    - Damage when using Knife (or knife throw) ability: `(Knife Ability Level x 3)`
    - If thrown, target to hit is reduced by -1
    - If thrown, automatically returned to characters if any other character enters the spot with the thrown claw

---

## Second Quest

Word of your first success has impressed the Queen. You believe the Queen will keep her word and reward your party well if you are able to find this amulet, so you venture further into the mountain. Your party soon finds a grand entrance buried deep in the cave - it must be the door to the ancient hall of Purlion, the previous ruling palace. With your combined force you are able to pry the door open just enough to squeeze everyone through.

That's when you hear the rocks outside the door begin to crumble and fall, blocking the door behind you. I suppose there's no way to go but forward now! You've heard of the ancient hall before, in stories. Supposedly, there is a second entrance - your exit - through the hall and up the mountain. Others have found that exit, but it has been locked for centuries. You will need to find the set of two keys that will unlock it!

### Quest Rules

This is a fully interior quest, and every space begins completely dark. All spaces are predefined (see below), and follow the pattern: hall, corridor, and then great room. The pattern then repeats until you find both keys. Once you have both keys, you have one more room: the stairs (the final exit for the quest is at the end of those stairs). Both keys must be on the exit space for the stairs in order to exit (and complete the quest).

* An Ace is a key, you can collect it by simply being on the space (this is a free action)
* A two of hearts or diamonds is a trap (follow rules in [Space Layout section](../../rules/05_space_layout.md))
* A two of spades or clubs is an enemy
* If a a three appears, the ceiling above partially collapses:
    - the three spot is always blocked (impassable and blocks line of sight)
    - flip an action card: on an 8 or less, the exit is now blocked, reveal the entire space and kill all enemies to allow time to dig it out
    - Regardless of your flip, an enemy drops down from the ceiling, place them on the spot adjacent to the three, toward the exit and add them to the initiative order

#### Starting Items

Before starting your quest:

* If you returned to the castle after the First Quest...
    - each player receives 1 healing potion and 1 [random starting item](reference_tables.md#starting-items)
* If you pressed on after the First Quest...
    - each player finds 1 healing potion in the cave (and that's it)

#### Space Layouts

For the layouts below, a `[]` represents a card in the layout, while a `XX` represents an empty spot. The `^` at the bottom is the entrance. The exit is always determined by a flip, see [Space Layout rules](../../rules/05_space_layout.md) **except** for the stairs, where the exit is always at the far end (see diagram).

> For two players, reduce the number of rows on any layout by 2 (in other words, 2 less rows of columns or stairs, etc)

#### Hall Layout

---

You exit the ancient ruins, a hard fought, perilous journey to be sure. But you will be stronger for it. Examining the keys you found, you notice the same strange script on the shaft of each key as you saw inside the amulet case. This must be the "old word" that all of the elders in the land speak of. Very few understand it any longer. You wonder if the long-dead words mean anything for your quest...

**Choose a character to attempt to decipher the text**. If that character has the "Scholar" ability they may use it, if not, they may use "Think" with +2 to the target (making it more difficult). The target for success is `(avgLv x 4)`, but the character may use Stamina, and 1 other character may assist them with a Stamina card of their own.

> **PAUSE HERE AND ATTEMPT TO DECIPHER!**

**On failure:**

* The character performing the deciphering gains `(Lv x 2 exp)`
* An assisting character gains `exp = Lv`

**On success:**

> **DO NOT** read this if you failed... **SPOILERS!!** Skip down to the quest bonuses.

* The character performing the deciphering gains +1 in Think
* The character performing the deciphering gains `(Lv x 2 exp)`
* An assisting character gains `exp = Lv`
* Although some of the text was unreadable from erosion, on the keys they read: "Fury of the f@#*y sun awaits" and "Prot#$!e% by many, prepare!"
* **If you returned to the castle after the First Quest**, then you cannot read the script in the amulet case, because you left it with the Queen.
    - **If you "pressed on" after the First Quest**, then the character also deciphers the text inside the amulet case. It says: "Stone guar*^ the pr@^~*#!ons you seek"
    - Curious, your party looks around the exit from the ruins and finds a hidden cache near the door.
    - All characters receive 1 piece of "decent armor" (see items table)
    - Each player decides what body part it fits on (but once decided, you cannot change it!)

#### Quest Bonuses

* Each character receives `(4 x Lv)` experience + [standard quest experience](../../rules/10_experience_and_leveling.md)
* Each character receives +2 levels in Move
* Any living character trained in any magic receives 1 healing potion and **either**: 2 Fire Elixirs or 2 Ice Elixirs
* Any living character _not_ trained in magic receives: 1 healing potion and 1 random item (flip for it)
* All characters heal to 90% `(max HP * 0.9)` (those already above 90% do not change)

## Third Quest

As your party gathers outside of the exit from the ancient castle Purlion a raven appears and lands on a large boulder near you. It caws twice, then begins to speak in a crackled, yet strong voice. "Well done, my heroes! Few have ever gotten this far in our time." The raven caws a few more times before continuing, looking around at your party. It can't actually recognize you, can it?

"Now you must continue up the mountain. My ravens have seen the glow of great magic near the summit. We believe the old wizard, Calico, may have the amulet! We cannot allow him to control its power."

Your party finally feels they are on the cusp of recovering the amulet. The path up the mountain, while no doubt treacherous, is clearly laid out in front of them. It is time to press on!

The raven begins to flap its wings to fly away and says, "these may help you continue your quest."

A flurry of ravens arrives as the first disappears down the mountain. Each one carrying a parcel, one for each character.

> Each player receives 1 healing potion and 1 [random starting item](reference_tables.md#starting-items).


### Quest Rules

The first space will be decided at random by flipping per the normal [space layout rules](../../rules/05_space_layout.md). The first space will always be exterior, daytime.

Once players make it through the first space, they will generate (and enter) another space, but **only flip 1 card** to determine the size of the space. This space will be interior and **fully lit**, that is, **all spaces will be revealed**, even if out of line of sight of the characters. As such, **all enemies are immediately revealed** and aware of your party.

The exit to the second space is blocked, you must kill all enemies to unblock it. **As soon as the last enemy is killed** the exit is unblocked, however, your party sees that the space is actually larger!

Award experience, level up if necessary, and reshuffle the Enemy deck. **DO NOT alter the current space layout!**

Now flip 1 Action card to determine the additional size of the space. Lay out these cards per normal rules, starting from the exit to the first space. In other words, increase the size of the space (versus layout out a new space). The new exit will be randomly determined per the usual rules. As before, all spots are **revealed immediately**, along with any enemies. In addition, to the new enemies, **any twos or threes from the previously revealed space _respawn_ as new enemies**.

Perform this expansion twice more (so three total expansions, plus the original space: four waves).

**Remember to reshuffle the Enemy deck between each expansion!**

Once that last expansion is complete, and **all enemies are defeated**, your party can make their way to the (now unblocked) exit. Note that [the "delay" rule](../../rules/09_leaving_a_space.md#delaying-your-exit) still applies!

* Any Ace is a normal chest
* Any two is an enemy, and respawns for each wave
* Any three is an enemy, and respawns for each wave

> **PAUSE HERE AND PLAY YOUR QUEST!**

> (The following section is for the end of the quest!)

---

You are able to defeat the last few enemies that were blocking the way and continue up the mountainside. It's been a tough battle, but you prevailed. You noticed a number of ravens circling overhead at various points during the skirmish and assume that the Queen has been watching. She'll be aware that you are nearing the summit now. You can even start to see the faint orange glow the Queen spoke of.

#### Quest Bonuses

* Each character receives `(4 x Lv)` experience + [standard quest experience](../../rules/10_experience_and_leveling.md)
* Each character receives +2 levels in Lift

In addition, each live party member receives either:

* +1 to a weapon-based ability level; **or**
* +1 to a damage-dealing magic ability level

If neither of the two options above are possible, the player receives:

* +1 point in Lift ability level; **and**
* +1 point in Balance ability level

If a character possesses the **"Queen's favor" coin**, read the following, otherwise the quest has ended! **DO NOT READ** this section if you don't have the coin, it contains **SPOILERS!!**

> As you all rest and recover, you pull out the coin you received from the Queen and turn it over in your hand. It glints in the sun and you hear a loud caw from above. You look up expecting to see a raven, but instead it is a mighty eagle. The eagle glides down and lands only a few yards away, cocks its head while looking at you, then looks at the coin.
> 
> This is obviously not a normal eagle, and it clearly is interested in the coin. You flip the coin in the air and catch it again. The eagle watches it flip through the air. You don't know exactly why you think this might work, but you flip the coin in the direction of the eagle.
> 
> With a swoop of one wing, the eagle envelopes the coin, spins rapidly, and begins to morph. Startled, the entire party braces for what may come next. In a matter of seconds the eagle transforms into a small chest with the Queen's emblem on the front. The party relaxes. "Did you all know she was that powerful?" the previous owner of the coin asks.
> 
> Inside the chest you find a scroll and a pouch. The pouch has a reviving potion and an ice elixir in it. The scroll appears to be instructions for a particular spell.
> 
> **The character who held the coin** may choose any character (including themselves) to use the scroll to learn a **new magical ability**. They _do not_ have to meet the pre-requisites to acquire this new ability.

## Fourth Quest

The entrance to the glowing lair at the top of the mountain is before you. You can hear the shrieking of beasts inside, but also a faint, low hum, almost like deep growl, but with a cadence that is almost... like a chorus. Regardless, this is your quest, and your party enters the lair to find and defeat the wizard Calico and retrieve the amulet.

### Quest Rules

The rooms of the lair follow standard [space layout rules](../../rules/05_space_layout.md). The Lair is all interior, and players should flip to see if any one room is lit or dark.

* The **first** Ace you reveal will be the wizard's apprentice (see below). The exit to the room you are in when this card is revealed is locked until you defeat the apprentice.
    - Any additional Aces in the _same room_ as the apprentice will be a trap.
* The **second** Ace you reveal (in a subsequent room) will be the wizard, Calico (see below). The exit will be locked until you defeat Calico.
    - Any additional Aces you reveal will be a trap.
* A two of hearts or diamonds is a double enemy
* A two of spades or clubs is a chest
* A three of hearts or diamonds a spike pit:
    - when revealed, if the player is _adjacent_ to the pit, they fall in
    - flip an action card: on a 4 or less, you take avgLv damage from the spikes
    - Regardless of your flip, you lose your next turn climbing out (you are now on the pit spot)
    - Any character entering this spot for any reason will fall and must flip and lose a turn
    - Enemies will avoid this spot as if it were blocked
* A three of spades or clubs is a secret passage (see [space layout rules](../../rules/05_space_layout.md))

#### The Apprentice

Place a marker on the spot where the apprentice appears (_do not flip a card from the Enemy deck_).

All _currently revealed_ enemies will still move and attack as usual, but **no new enemies appear** in this room. Any spots revealed that would be enemies are empty spots.

* Apprentice will always have the highest initiative and immediately take their turn (then resume previous place in the order)
* Basic Stats:
    - HP: `(AvgLv * 12)`
    - Move: 2
    - -1 to target to defend against any magic
    - +1 to target to defend against any melee attack
* Apprentice varies their attack. Use the [standard move and target rules for enemies](../../rules/08_enemy_turns.md), however:
    - At R=0: staff bonk, target: `(7 - AvgLv)`, damage: `(AvgLv + Over + 3)`
    - At R=1-5: Fire Ball magic, target: `(9 - AvgLv + R)`, damage: `((AvgLv x 2) + Over)`
    - At R>5: no attack (but will move)
* Will never retreat as they fear reprisal from Calico, ignore any instructions for enemies under 1/4 HP to flee

#### Calico the Wizard

Place a marker on the spot where the apprentice appears (_do not flip a card from the Enemy deck_).

All other enemies will flee immediately (remove them from the table), and **no new enemies appear** in this room. Any spots revealed that would be enemies are empty spots.

* Calico will always have the highest initiative and immediately take their turn (then resume previous place in the order)
* Basic Stats:
    - HP: `(AvgLv * 25)`
    - Move: 2, floating (can go over traps)
    - -1 to target to defend against any magic involving ice or water
    - +1 to target to defend against any melee or non-magic ranged attack
* Calico varies his attack. Use the [standard move and target rules for enemies](../../rules/08_enemy_turns.md), however:
    - At R=0, melee attack with his sharpened metal staff: target: `(10 - AvgLv)`, damage: `((Over x 2) + AvgLv)`
    - At R=1-3, Fire Ball magic, target: `(8 - AvgLv + R)`, damage: `((AvgLv x 3) + Over)`
    - At R=4-5, Calico will move per usual rules
    - At R>5, Calico summons a cave beast to attack the party. The location will be the spot where there character with the most HP (currently, not max) is located.
        - The beast will then attach, in descending HP order, each character within 1 spot of the original target.
        - The beast will attack each character with target: `(11 - AvgLv)` and damage `(AvgLv x 2)`
        - All characters will have a +2 to their target to defend
        - Calico will then **also** move per usual rules
* Calico is weak against ice or water magic, characters' damage will be increased 1.5x
* When under 1/4 HP Calico will retreat per the usual rules, but will also heal:
    - Flip for the amount of HP recovered
* When Calico's HP falls below 0, flip an Action card:
    - if the card is an Ace, Calico vanishes and reappears either at the entrance or exit, whichever is furthest from the nearest character, and heals to 1/4 HP
    - if the card is 2-5, Calico heals to 1/8 HP and moves two spots in a direction taking him away from characters
    - on any other value, Calico is defeated

> **PAUSE HERE AND PLAY YOUR QUEST!**

---

Calico hisses in pain as he crumples to the cave floor. You all approach him slowly, still on guard. He doesn't move, but you hold your weapon ready as you reach for the amulet held in his hand. It appears he had been using it to summon those creatures and cast the fire ball spell. You nudge him slightly and he flinches! You all jump back, but realize that it was just final muscle spasm of an old man.

You exit the lair, amulet safely in a pouch, and squint as the bright sun shines down on your glorious success!

It takes you a full day and night to get down the Lichanden mountains and through the forest in the foothills. As you pass through the villages below the mountain you are hailed as heroes! The townsfolk have seen that the glow from the mountain is gone, and the beasts that had invaded their lands have all retreated. You rest briefly at a couple of the villages and eat and drink and tell the story of your quest.

After another day of walking you arrive at the castle of Queen Katya of Mioweth and enter her great hall. She is stoic as you approach, but as soon as you reveal the Scarlet Amulet of Lasoor from its pouch, her eyes grow wide and she squeals in delight.

"You are truly heroes!" She exclaims. "Thank you for saving my people. Please, rest here, use any of the castle resources you need, and don't go far... there are other troubles I could use your help with!"
