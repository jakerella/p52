The land of Mioweth has been at peace for over two hundred years. Their people are simple folk, living in mostly stone dwellings and primarily focused on agriculture. They have been trading more and more with outside groups, but they still produce most of their own food and clothing. Of course, with trade comes interaction with other peoples, and other skills.

Mioweth has recently seen numerous attacks in the outlying villages by terrible beasts, especially the villages in the foothills of the Lichanden mountains. The mountains have long been seen as a possible source of evil, with stories going back hundreds of years. Not too long ago, sentries in the forests observed a strange glow emanating from caves up the mountain side.

Fearing for her people, the Queen of Mioweth, Katya, sent a contingent of soldiers to investigate. They were never heard from again. Now, her forces fear any excursion that even comes close to the mountain. Something must be done!

After returning from a voyage to distant Rufanthia, you and your mates decided to rest up at the inn above the tavern in Tabantha. It was in the tavern that you were approached by a strange woman, shrouding her identity with a heavy cloak and partial mask.

"Why the mask?" You asked her. "Were you horribly scarred or something?"

"No," she answers, "I just find them terribly comfortable. I think everyone will be wearing them soon. But that's not why I'm here."


## First Quest

The shrouded woman int he tavern goes on to explain that she has a mission for your group, direct from the Queen. She describes the recent attacks and says that the Queen believes they may be creatures trying to find the Scarlet Amulet of Lasoon, thought lost to time over a hundred years ago. The Queen has had visions of the amulet in her dreams, and needs you to find it and return it safely to the castle.

The amulet is said to have great power, giving those who possess it unmatched magical prowess. Of course, you will be rewarded handsomely when you return the amulet to her.

You will start your quest ...

### Quest Rules

This quest has the party making their way to  - and then through - the old ruins of Castle Nordoon. The first 3 spaces will be exterior, then this becomes an interior quest for the remainder of the session.

Keep track of how many rooms you go through. An Ace in a room is a special chest and an enemy is always defending it (so draw one for this spot). After successfully opening the chest (just like normal), you must see if your item is in it: draw one card from the Action deck, if the card is 6 or lower this item is a fake and your quest continues (find the next special chest).

Once you find the shiny item, you need to go back through the same number of rooms (minus 1 for the one you are in) to get out! Don't forget that ONE of you has to survive with the item!

BONUS: After completing, each character receives an Adrenaline Boost item to add to their inventory for use on the next game session and 5 x Level experience.

P52 quest bonus awarded, plus each live party member receives a new piece of Decent armor.

## Second Quest

The Queen has been impressed with your party's ability to get things done. She has asked you to go in search of the crazy wizard in the mines. Soon after you enter them, the entrance collapses trapping you inside! Not to worry though, there is another exit, but it appears that all of the doors are locked.

### Quest Rules

interior

You need to collect two keys in order to complete the quest, find a room with an Ace (a key); go to the spot with the Ace to collect it (add it to  your inventory), this is a free action.

Once TWO keys are collected, the next room will be the last room. Both keys are required to exit this room. That is, both keys must be at the exit spot at the same time, if a player with a key dies, another player may collect the key from the spot the dead player is on. You do not need to kill all enemies.

BONUS: After completing, each character receives +3 Levels in Move and 5 x Level experience points.
COMPLETION BONUS:
P52 quest bonus awarded, plus each live party member receives either:
2 Healing Potions; or

## Third Quest

After making your way out of the mines, your party realizes that there are monsters all around the forest. You had best make your way back to the Queen fast to report what you've seen… that is, if you can make it back alive.

### Quest Rules

exterior

Flip a card from the Room deck to determine number of rooms:
# Rooms = (14 - Flip) / 2     (Rounded down)

For this quest, the exit of each room will be barricaded until all enemies in the room are defeated (and the room is completely revealed).

BONUS: After completing, each character receives +3 Levels in Lift and 5 x Level experience points.
COMPLETION BONUS:
P52 quest bonus awarded, plus each live party member receives either:
+1 to a weapon-based ability; or

## Fourth Quest

A warlock has been consumed with hatred after years of ridicule for his lack of a proper wizard's beard. He has been terrorizing the land with his evil magic. You have been tasked by the Queen to find him… and eliminate him.

### Quest Rules

BASIC RULES...
An Ace in a room is a Boss, the first to appear is a Minor Boss, the second is the Major Boss. Minor Bosses are simply a regular enemy (Flip from the Enemy deck) with all suit bonuses for that enemy type (see Enemies).

The Major Boss is tough (high HP), uses a ranged attack when farther than away and a melee attack within the same spot. All damage is pretty high. They can also heal, move, and possibly use other abilities. Check your scenario to see what they can do specifically.

When the Major Boss is revealed do not turn over any other enemies (and existing enemies will flee immediately).

You must defeat both Bosses, but you can run from either (when you leave the room they regain full strength). If you run, the next Ace you see is the boss you ran from.
The quest is completed as soon as the Major Boss is defeated (no need to exit the room).

BONUS: After completing, each character gains +1 Level in any attacking ability; +1 Level in any defending or healing ability; and 5 x Level experience points.
