| ------------- | ------------- | ----- |
| Treasure Hunt | Ooooh, shiny! Remember that special thing the High Leader always asked for? Well, we know it's in a chest around here somewhere. Find it for them! | This is essentially a hunt for a specific treasure chest. Generally an Ace represents a chest. The scenario will tell you **which chest is the right one**. That may be based on a sequence, a number of dungeon rooms, etc. Regardless a strong enemy should always be protecting that chest! There should also be some escape shenanigans, like flipping an Action card to see how many rooms you have to escape through. |
| Trapped       | We're trapped down here! We need to find the hidden keys and escape. | You need to collect some number of keys in order to complete the quest. Keys may be on certain enemies, or in chests, depending on the scenario. There may also be escape conditions, like using a pair of keys in a certain way to unlock the exit. |
| Survival      | There's too many of 'em! We just need to hold out a little longer. | The idea is just to crawl the dungeon and survive. The scenario states how many enemies or rooms there are in some novel fashion. Often players will need to defeat all enemies in a room before progressing. |
| Big Boss      | Uh oh, they look tough. | Generally a scenario will dictate that you need to defeat a minor _and_ a big boss. Often an Ace will represent a Boss in a room layout, with the first to appear being the Minor Boss, the second the Big Boss. The bosses are generally stronger than other enemies and can often heal or move in some unique way. |


(Original Table from "Setting Up a Session")

Treasure Hunt
Remember that special thing the High Leader always asked for? Well, we know it's in a chest around here somewhere. Find it for them!
Keep track of how many rooms you go through. An Ace in a room is a special chest and an enemy is always defending it (so draw one for this spot). After successfully opening the chest (just like normal), you must see if your item is in it: draw one card from the Action deck, if the card is 6 or lower this item is a fake and your quest continues (find the next special chest).
Once you find the shiny item, you need to go back through the same number of rooms (minus 1 for the one you are in) to get out! Don't forget that ONE of you has to survive with the item!
BONUS: After completing, each character receives an Adrenaline Boost item to add to their inventory for use on the next game session and 5 x Level experience.

Trapped
We're trapped, and the only way out is to collect a pair of hidden keys somewhere in the area. When you see a key, grab it and hold on, you'll need it to escape.
You need to collect two keys in order to complete the quest, find a room with an Ace (a key); go to the spot with the Ace to collect it (add it to  your inventory), this is a free action.
Once TWO keys are collected, the next room will be the last room. Both keys are required to exit this room. That is, both keys must be at the exit spot at the same time, if a player with a key dies, another player may collect the key from the spot the dead player is on. You do not need to kill all enemies.
BONUS: After completing, each character receives +3 Levels in Move and 5 x Level experience points.

Survival
There are enemies everywhere, and you have to defeat them all! Hold out as long as you can.
Flip a card from the Room deck to determine number of rooms:
# Rooms = (14 - Flip) / 2     (Rounded down)
For this quest, the exit of each room will be barricaded until all enemies in the room are defeated (and the room is completely revealed).
BONUS: After completing, each character receives +3 Levels in Lift and 5 x Level experience points.

Big Boss
Uh oh, they look tough. You'll need to defeat two bosses (one minor and one major) in order to make it through this ordeal.
An Ace in a room is a Boss, the first to appear is a Minor Boss, the second is the Major Boss. Minor Bosses are simply a regular enemy (Flip from the Enemy deck) with all suit bonuses for that enemy type (see Enemies).
The Major Boss is tough (high HP), uses a ranged attack when farther than away and a melee attack within the same spot. All damage is pretty high. They can also heal, move, and possibly use other abilities. Check your scenario to see what they can do specifically.
When the Major Boss is revealed do not turn over any other enemies (and existing enemies will flee immediately).
You must defeat both Bosses, but you can run from either (when you leave the room they regain full strength). If you run, the next Ace you see is the boss you ran from.
The quest is completed as soon as the Major Boss is defeated (no need to exit the room).
BONUS: After completing, each character gains +1 Level in any attacking ability; +1 Level in any defending or healing ability; and 5 x Level experience points.
