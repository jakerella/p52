Chests and Items


The most common way to get an item will be by opening a chest. See the Chest Items table in your scenario for what items are possible.
Opening Chests
Attempting to open a chest consumes a player's turn - even if the attempt is unsuccessful. In order to open a chest the player will want to use the Lock Picking ability. To open a chest using this ability, simply move to the spot with the chest and take a turn to open it using the ability. Flip a card from the Action deck to see how you did, you will need to meet or exceed your target for that ability (similar to attacking) in order to succeed.
Flipping an Ace results in a broken lock. When a lock is broken, the chest can only be opened by attacking (see Attacking a Chest below). You may attempt to open a chest as many times as you wish, but keep in mind that it takes a full turn each time.
If you flip a King, the chest contains two items. Determine what they are individually, but in the same manner described below.
If a player is not trained in the Lock Picking ability, they can still use this method using a Lock Pick item. Attempting to open a chest with a Lock Pick consumes the lock pick if you fail, thus after the attempt - if unsuccessful - remove the item from the player's inventory. For this method, assume a single ability level for each Lock Pick used. For example, if you use 3 Lock Picks, it is as if you had a 3 in the Lock Pick ability. Now attempt to open the lock as described above.
Using each Lock Pick adds a +2 to your attempt if you are already trained in Lock Picking.

Revealing the Item
Once a chest is open, you flip two cards from your Action deck and use the card total in combination with the Chest Items table in your scenario to determine what you have found. Place any item received in your character's inventory. Note that you do not have to take the item, and if you do not it remains on that spot. There is no limit to the number of items you can hold.
If you both of the cards are the same suit in your flips to reveal the item, then you also gain 1 Lock Pick item, add it to your inventory.

Attacking a Chest
If the lock on a chest has been broken - or if you simply choose not to use the Lock Picking ability or a Lock Pick item - you may attack the chest in order to open it. Flip a card from your Action deck, then add that value to: (Think / 3). A 10 or greater value opens the chest, a 3 or less destroys the chest and any item in it. A King will still reveal a chest with two items in it. On a flip of an Ace, the chest explodes and you take (2 x avgLv) HP of damage.
You may use Stamina to increase your flip value in this case.

Equipping (and Unequipping) Items
On your turn you can choose to equip an item that is not consumable. For example, a piece of armor or a weapon may be equipped, but a potion may not. This process does not consume your turn, but it must be done before any other actions. Once an item is equipped, its effects are applied to all future actions. You cannot have more than one item equipped on the same body part, and you should be sensible about other items. You may be able to have a sword and a knife equipped, but certainly not a sword and a bow. Consider equipping what you would be holding in your hands, not what is in your satchel.
You may also choose to unequip an item you have previously equipped - this does not consume your turn, but must also be done before any other actions.
