General Steps


This section is intended to give you an overview of the flow of the game. Refer to the sections below for more detailed instructions.
After completing the pre-play setup (see Session Setup above) your party will set out on their quest. The general steps are these:

Shuffle Room and Enemy decks (separately)
Determine the size and details of the next room
Lay out the room
Enter the room and make your way through it defeating enemies and gathering items 
(eventually getting to the exit)
Exit the room and determine experience (and level up if necessary)
Repeat all steps until the quest is complete or all players are dead

The playing session ends either when your quest has been completed or all party members (characters) are defeated. After finishing a quest, you should sort out any remaining experience or bonuses from the quest and do any necessary leveling up (see Leveling Up later in this document).
Using a Session Log
When you start a new game session you may want to consider using a session log to track what happens. There is a Session Log example sheet toward the end of this document that you can use, or create your own with all of the information you need. The idea is to track the quest being undertaken, the location, the players, and what happens. Most often this means what enemies you encounter and how they are dealt with. Doing this will help when assessing experience points after each room (and at the end of the session).
