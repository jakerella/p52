# P52 - A Playing Card Deck RPG System

> Version 1.4

## Introduction

These are the basic rules and instructions for a new version of an old game. The idea was to create a Role Playing Game (RPG) with as few necessary supplies/pieces (fewer things to buy and carry with you). The game is much more simple than most RPGs, requiring no Dungeon Master (DM), and only 2 decks of standard playing cards, these instructions, pencil and paper, and a placeholder for each character. While these instructions may seem long for players new to RPG systems, they are significantly shorter than the instructions for most RPGs - some of which are printed in numerous 100+ page volumes.

Many of the ideas in this game are intentionally generic to allow for expansion and alteration. In fact, this manual is published under a Creative Commons license (see License below) so that anyone can copy and modify the rules to fit their needs. All I ask is that you share it with others (and give credit to those that came before you).

If you have an idea for an alternate rule or a completely different theme: try it out, write it down, and share it! New abilities, items, quirks, and more are always welcome.

* **Players**: 1-6
* **Supplies**: 2 x playing card decks, paper & pencil, these instructions (plus a scenario), player markers
* **Time**: First Play, ~3 hours (_Instructions. Character Creation, 1 dungeon_); Subsequent Plays: 1-2 hours

### Basic Play

Because this is a role playing game with persistent player characters, there isn't a "quick start" per se, but below are the things you need to do (with links to the relevant pages) to get started.

#### First Time Playing

1. Learn the [general mechanics](01_general_mechanics.md) of the RPG system and [player](06_player_turns.md) and [enemy](08_enemy_turns.md) turns (~30 min)
2. [Create your character(s)](02_creating_a_character.md) using the guide (~10 min)
3. Pick a quest from your chosen scenario and [set up your first game session](03_setting_up_a_session.md) (~10 min)
4. Lay out your [first space](05_space_layout.md) and start moving through the quest! (~1.5 hours)
5. Complete your quest and [collect experience (and maybe level up)](10_experience_and_leveling.md) (~5 min)

#### Subsequent Plays

1. Refresh yourself of your characters' abilities (~ 5 min)
2. Pick a quest from your chosen scenario and [set up your game session](03_setting_up_a_session.md) (~10 min)
4. Lay out your [first space](05_space_layout.md) and start moving through the quest! (~1-2 hours)
5. Complete your quest and [collect experience (and maybe level up)](10_experience_and_leveling.md) (~5 min)

### What you will need

Here's the great part: all you need is **two standard playing card decks** (52 cards each, no jokers). Well, that's not exactly true, you will also need some **paper and a pencil** (trust me, don't use pen), **these instructions**, and something to **mark where your characters are** (small figures, or maybe a few coins or stones). If you wish, you can use some pennies to mark where chests are, or certain other items, etc. While the game is complex, it is intended to be played just about anywhere with minimal supplies.

### Time

If this is your first time playing you will need some time to get used to the rules (although players who have played any common table-top RPG should take little time to figure things out). Character creation can take anywhere from 5 to 30 minutes depending on how involved and creative you get (and we recommend spending a lot of time here). Each game session will take anywhere from one to two hours, with each room varying in length greatly.
