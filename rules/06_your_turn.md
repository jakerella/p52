Entering a Room


Once the layout of the room (or “space” if exterior) is complete, move your entire party onto the starting spot - you do not all have to move together, but you all must start together in any room.
Initiative
If there are any visible enemies (that is, any that are on lit spots), Flip a card from your Action deck to see if either party gets the drop on the other. On an Ace, all enemies will go first – in initiative order – before any player; then play continues in initiative order from the highest value down. On a King all players will go first in initiative order before any enemy; then play continues as usual in initiative order from the highest value down. On any other card, play begins with the highest initiative character (player or enemy) and on down in initiative order.
For dark rooms/spaces, if there are no visible enemies, the players may move freely until one appears. When a player moves onto a spot which reveals an enemy (see Player Movement below), the player should flip an Action card; on a 3 or less the enemy will take their turn next, then play will continue in initiative order (which may mean that enemy gets another turn very soon).


On Your Turn


There are a few different things you can do on your turn, but in general you can only do one of those things on any one turn (there are some exceptions). On any turn you may also choose to do nothing (basically passing your turn to the next player or enemy) – this will gain you one Stamina card.
You may also choose to wait one turn before taking your turn (thus allowing another player, or even an enemy, to go before you) – note that you can do this as many times as you want, but if your turn comes around again you do not receive an extra turn, your previous turn simply ends (and you get no bonus Stamina card).
Player Movement
Possibly the simplest thing you can do is move your character within the room. Check your "Movement" skill on your character sheet to see how many spots you can move. You cannot move diagonally, but otherwise you are free to move in any direction. An individual character may not leave the room - see Leaving a Room below for information on how that happens. Players do not have to go their entire Movement amount on any turn (so if you have a movement of 3, you can choose to go 1 or 2 spots).

Revealing Dark Spaces
As you move through a dark space you will reveal more of the spots. Any time you move to a new spot, flip over any face-down spot cards based on the light in the room. You can read more about Revealing the Room above.

Passing Attacks
If you move into a spot with an enemy and then attempt to move out of the spot on the same turn then the enemy will get a chance to attack you as you run past – regardless of their initiative. This attack behaves exactly like a normal attack (see Enemy Attacking below) except that the enemy has a +1 to their target (you are harder to hit). If the enemy attack flip is a king, you must stop on the spot – regardless of what damage (if any) you have taken; otherwise you can defend, take whatever damage is dealt, and then continue moving. Note that a player may counter attack, but if they do so they must stop on that space for the remainder of that turn.

Player Attacking
Choose the ability you wish to use and an enemy to target, then flip a card from the Action deck to determine the attack's effectiveness (in other words: did you hit the enemy). The enemy then gets a defense (in some cases), which is determined by another flip of the Action deck. If your total is higher than the enemy’s defense, then you deal damage.
For example, if you choose to use the “Knife” ability and have a level of 2 in that ability, then you would choose an enemy on your spot (it is not a ranged attack) and flip a card - lets say you flipped a 10. Since the 10 is over the target for the Knife ability (9 - aLv(2) = 7) you will succeed in hitting the enemy. Now the enemy has a chance to defend. Let's say you flip a 6 for the enemy, this is lower than your total of 10, thus the enemy will take damage.
The damage as indicated by the Abilities table will be:
(your level in Balance / 2) + (amount Over target x 2)
which would become:
(7 / 2) + (3 x 2) = 9    (assuming your level in Balance was 7)
Note that all division is rounded down, so 7 / 2 is 3.

Enemy Items
When an enemy is defeated, they may drop a random item. To see if they have, flip a card from the Action deck, if it is a face card, they have dropped an item! You will need to move to the spot the enemy was killed on to collect the item. Determine what type of item you have by the same method you would with a chest. (See the Opening Chests section below for information on how to do so.)

Using Stamina
If this particular attack is very important to get right, you can play a Stamina card from your pile in order to increase your total (thus increasing your chance to hit and your Over value). However, you must choose to play a Stamina card before flipping for your attack! Note that you do not get to “pick” your Stamina card, just flip over the top card.

Power Attacks
If you are lucky enough to flip a King on your attack then you will deal double damage should your enemy fail in their defense, but only if you actually deal some damage (in other words, if the damage is zero, this will not add to it).

Counter Attacks
Should you flip an Ace on your attack flip (regardless of your target and/or Stamina flip or lack of one) you will fail at your attack and the enemy will get a counter attack right away. This works just like a regular attack, and you may defend against it.

Enemy Defending
An enemy will always try to defend an attack unless their specific character cannot defend the specific type of attack (or not at that time for some reason). This is represented as a simple opposing flip (described above) to your attack flip plus any modifiers or Stamina. If the opposed flip is higher than your attack, no damage is dealt. If the two numbers are equal, then only half damage is dealt.
For example, if you use a Stamina card that has a value of 4 and flip an 6 for your attack, then your total is 10. In order for an enemy to defend against this attack (and thus receive no damage), they must flip a Jack or better (Jack = 11, Queen = 12, King = 13).

Attack/Item Range
Any time that an ability, weapon, or item indicates it is a Ranged attack (or for anything else with a "Range" attribute) there will be a number associated with it. A Range of 0 indicates that the ability (or item) can only be used on the same spot the player (or enemy) is located. A Range of 1 indicates that the ability (or item) can be used on the player's spot and one adjacent - note that a diagonal spot is not adjacent for attacking and item usage purposes. A Range of 2 goes one spot further and so forth.

Line of Sight
When using a ranged attack (i.e. a bow) the player must have a "line of sight" to the enemy. This line includes diagonal directions - but note the section above regarding Attack/Item Range calculations for the actual attack. In general this rule means that an enemy across a gap in the room cannot be attacked by the player on the other side (and vice versa).
In the example below, Player 1 can attack Enemy 1, but not Enemy 2 - and the other way around, Enemy 1 could attack Player 1, but Enemy 2 cannot. Note that although they cannot attack you, the Enemies do know you are there (unless you are stealthy somehow), and will move to find you.

	Player 1
	Enemy 1
	Enemy 2




Aiming
You may choose to wait a turn and aim at (or concentrate on) an enemy instead. Doing so will add a +1 to your hit Flip for your next attack. You may aim for as many turns as you like, but only for a maximum potential bonus of +3. You cannot take any other actions to maintain the bonus - in other words, you cannot aim, then move, then attack and still receive the bonus. Nor can you defend against other attacks (if you want to maintain the bonus). And if you are hit by any attack your bonus will reset.
As soon as you attack an enemy, the bonus resets. Also note that you must indicate which enemy you are aiming at beforehand, and while enemy movement does not change your aim, you cannot transfer this bonus to another enemy or action (but your bonus does still apply if the enemy moves). This bonus may be used on counter-attacks, but only on the enemy you were aiming at.

Defensive Stance
While you may defend any attack separately (see Player Defending below), you can also choose to take a defensive stance during your turn. Doing so will add a +1 to your ability to defend on the next turn. You can take this stance as long as you like for a maximum potential bonus of +3. You cannot take any other actions on your turn to maintain the bonus; however, if you successfully defend an attack while using this bonus you may continue to take your defensive stance and maintain your bonus. As soon as you take any other action your bonus is lost.
If you are hit while taking a defensive stance - and you fail to defend against it or choose not to defend - then your bonus will reset.

Using an Item or Opening a Chest
You may use any item in your inventory on your turn - whether on yourself or another player. See the Chests and Items section below for specifics. Most items may be used at any time during your turn, although some items may restrict this. Attempting to open a chest also consumes your turn (see Opening Chests below).
Note that trading items among players is a free action and does not consume your turn, but it can only be done on your turn (before any other action) and only while the two players are on the same spot. In other words, if player 1 and player 2 are on the same spot, player 1 could trade as many items as they like with player 2, then move on the same turn. However, player 1 could not move onto the same spot as player 2 and then trade items that same turn.
