## Leaving a Space

The party may leave any space that has an unlocked and unblocked exit at any time they choose; however, they should review the quest details thoroughly. Exits will often be blocked for various reasons! In order to leave a space all players must be on the exit spot. The players will not actually leave until the next turn of the player with the highest initiative. In other words, if there are three players and two of them are at the exit, the turn in which the third player gets to the exit is not the turn your party leaves. The enemies may get another turn, and then when we reach the top of the initiative order (and reach the first player in that order), the party may leave.

### Delaying Your Exit

If there are **no visible enemies** in a space (you may not have revealed all of the room yet) and the **exit spot is visible** you must flip a card from the Action deck after each round of player turns to see if a new, random enemy will appear from the exit. If that Flip is 4 or lower then a new enemy appears on the exit spot and takes their turn immediately. Reveal this enemy just as you would normally. The enemy will behave just as usual.

Any time there is an enemy in the room you do not need to Flip for delay (including enemies that show up by delaying), but as soon as there are no more enemies in a room you must resume this process.

For example, let's say there are three players, Player 2 defeats the last enemy in the room, then Player 3 takes their turn, then each player takes another turn. After Player 3 takes that second turn, flip for delay. If you did not get an enemy this time, each player takes another turn. Once again, after Player 3's turn, flip for an enemy. Repeat this process until the party leaves the room or an enemy appears.

Note that you do not need to flip for delay until the exit spot is revealed. Thus, upon entering a dark room, you do not need to immediately begin flipping for delay.
