## Experience and Leveling

After exiting a space players will receive experience (exp) points which are used to gain levels (see Leveling Up below). Each player that is alive will receive +5 to their experience for completing a any space. In addition, players can gain experience for the following actions (note that these are for individual players, not the group as a whole).

* For each unique enemy attacked (not necessarily defeated), gain +1 exp
* For each successful use of a defensive ability, gain +1 exp
* For each enemy defeated, gain +3/+5/+7 exp (for Jacks, Queens, and Kings respectively)
* For each Chest successfully opened by Lock Picking (either trained or untrained), gain +3 exp
* For attacking 3 or more enemies with the _same_ attack type, gain +1 to one of that attack's base attributes
    * For example, if you defeat 3 enemies with Black Magic, +1 to your Think attribute
* For successfully defending 3 or more attacks with the _same_ defensive ability, gain +1 to one of the base attributes for that ability
* For each successful use of another ability (not an attack, defense, or lock pick), gain +1 exp
    * This must be an ability you had to flip to succeed at
* For each instance of you inflicting damaged to another player in your party, for any reason, lose -3 exp

### Leveling Up

Leveling up occurs after experience is awarded, but before any other actions (such as setting up and entering the next space). Gaining levels will add to the difficulty of the enemies, but also means the player is stronger. A player should increase their Level any time their experience reaches the next Level's threshold. The player's current threshold is `(Current Level x 10) + 10` (so for a Level 2 player, they will move up to Level 3 when their experience reaches 30).

When a player gains a Level they should do the following, in order:

1. Add points to their core abilities, the number of points is determined by: `Action Flip / 2`
    * Players may distribute the points among the core abilities any way they want
2. Increase basic skills (HP, Movement, and Initiative) based on new core ability levels
3. Add a new ability on **odd Levels only**
    * Players must qualify for the ability by meeting minimum core ability levels
4. Remove the required experience points to Level Up
    * For example, a player moving from Level 2 to Level 3 should subtract 30 points from the current experience
5. Increase other abilities as possible and desired (see below)

> Remember that enemies play to the average Level (AvgLv) of all players. To determine this, add all player levels, divide by the number of players and round down. For example, if there are three players with Levels of 3, 5, and 6 then the average player Level will be:
> `(3 + 5 + 6) / 3 = 4.7 â†’ 4`

### Increasing Basic Skills

Any time that you increase your core attributes you should double check that your Movement, maximum Hit Points (max HP), and Initiative are up to date on your [character sheet](guides/P52-character-sheet.pdf).

### Increasing Other Abilities

When leveling up, a player may choose to **spend experience points** to increase a specific ability's level. The amount of experience required to increase an ability is listed in the Abilities table in your scenario. Remove this experience from your [character sheet](guides/P52-character-sheet.pdf) and increase the level of that ability. You cannot gain a new ability this way! You cannot use the same experience points to level up your character and increase an ability.

### Running Out of Abilities

Should your character be so amazing that they have mastered all of the abilities, then you have three choices:

1. Kill everything in your path and grow to insurmountable strength.
2. Start a new character and build them up with new abilities and attributes.
3. Create a new ability! And while you're at it, maybe tinker with the rules to make the game more challenging!
