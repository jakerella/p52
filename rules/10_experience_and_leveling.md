Gaining Experience and Leveling Up


After exiting a room/space players will receive experience (exp) points which are used to gain levels (see Leveling Up below). Each player that is alive will receive +5 to their experience for completing a room. In addition, players can gain experience for the following actions (note that these are for individual players, not the group as a whole).
For each unique enemy attacked (not necessarily defeated), gain +1 exp
For each successful attack defense, gain +1 exp
For each enemy defeated, gain +3/+5/+7 exp (for Jacks, Queens, and Kings respectively)
For each Chest successfully opened by Lock Picking, gain +3 exp
For each Chest opened by attacking, gain +1 exp
For attacking 3 or more enemies with the same attack type, gain +1 to one of its base attributes
(For example, if you defeat 3 enemies with Black Magic, +1 to your Think attribute)
For successfully defending 3 or more attacks with the same defensive ability, gain +1 to one of the attributes for that ability
For each successful use of another ability not discussed above (one in which you had to flip to succeed), gain +2 exp
For each instance of damaging another player in your party, for any reason, lose -3 exp

Leveling Up
Leveling up occurs after experience is awarded, but before any other actions (such as setting up and entering the next room). Gaining levels will add to the difficulty of the enemies, but also means the player is stronger. A player will increase their Level any time their experience reaches the next Level's threshold. A Level's threshold is (Current Level x 10) + 10 (so for a Level 2 player, they will move up to Level 3 when their experience reaches 30).
When a player gains a Level they should do the following:
Add points to their core abilities, the number of points is determined by: Action Flip / 2
(distributed among the abilities any way they want, but only to core abilities)
Increase basic skills (HP, Movement, Initiative) based on new core ability levels
Add a new ability on odd Levels only (and they must qualify for the ability – that is, they must have the required amount in the core abilities – see the Abilities table for more on this)
Remove the required experience points to Level Up (for example, a player moving from Level 2 to Level 3 should subtract 30 points from the current experience (it is consumed while leveling up)
Increase any other abilities desired (see description of this process below)
Remember that enemies play to the average Level (Avg Lv) of all players. To determine this, add all player levels, divide by the number of players and round down. For example, if there are three players with Levels of 3, 5, and 6 then the average player Level will be:
(3 + 5 + 6) / 3 = 4.7 → 4


Increasing Basic Skills
Any time that you increase your core attributes you should double check that your Movement, maximum Hit Points (max HP), and Initiative are up to date. You can find those calculations in the Step 6: Determine Other Attributes section, or possibly on your Character Sheet (see the example Character Sheet below).

Increasing Other Abilities
During the time when players can level up, a player may choose to spend experience points to increase a specific ability’s level (versus their character level). The amount of experience required to increase an ability is listed in the Abilities table in your scenario. Remove this experience from your character sheet and increase the level of that ability. You cannot gain a new ability this way! Any experience used in this manner is taken out of your experience points after leveling up. In other words, you cannot use the same experience points to level up your character and an ability.

Running Out of Abilities
Should your character be so amazing that they have mastered all of the abilities, then you have three choices:
Kill everything in your path and grow to insurmountable strength.
Start a new character and build them up with new abilities and attributes.
Create a new ability! And while you're at it, maybe tinker with the rules to make the game more challenging!
