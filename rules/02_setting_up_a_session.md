## Setting Up a Session

Each time you play the game you will need to select a scenario and a quest to play. This step is only done once per game session and should be the first thing you do. Of course, if you are continuing an existing scenario, then you only need to set up the next quest.

> Make sure to record the information about your session in a [Session Log](guides/P52-session-log.pdf)!

### Choose a Scenario

We use the word "scenario" here because quests exist on a timeline, and those timelines make up a scene that your party partakes in. Each scenario will have multiple quests in it, but they might all be in the same reality or universe. In other words, you might have a universe where your band of mates go on many adventures, broken up into "scenarios" and "quests".

While a quest is meant to take place within a single play session, scenarios tend to be larger. While you can do them in one session, it might be best to break things up.

You can read and choose from [the official scenarios](scenarios/) here, or [make one of your own](rules/13_creating_your_own_scenario.md)!


### Choose a Quest

Once you have chosen a scenario (or when continuing a scenario), the next step is to choose a quest for your character(s). Often within a scenario the quests will be ordered to form a storyline. While you do not necessarily have to do these in order, that is how the story was written. Other scenarios may simply be a loose collection of quests in the same universe, in which case you should choose whichever quest sounds good that day!

Every quest will have a description of the setting and goal, certain starting items, and a bonus for completing it. Note that for any quest bonuses, the "Level" used is the final character level after all experience outside of the bonus has been applied.

### Determine the Environment

In general, each quest will either take place inside or outside. If your scenario specifies where this quest is, then you can use that, but it may also give you options.

The difference between interior and exterior quests is generally the lighting conditions, but your scenario may specify other conditions. For interior campaigns each room may be lit or may be dark - and thus you may or may not be able to see the enemies and other things in the room beyond the spot you are on. See the section on "Space Layout" later on to learn how this is decided.

Exterior environments will either be light or dark depending on whether it is day time or night time - and there is a day/night cycle which determines this. **If your quest specifies the time of day** then you should skip the next step.

If the quest does _not_ specify the exterior day/night conditions, then you must flip a card from the top of the **Room Deck**: a red card means you will start at day break, a black card will indicate starting at sunset. Each day (or night) lasts for 1 space (one room setup), thus upon entering the second space the day/night cycle flips - that is, if it was day, it becomes night. Repeat this process for each additional exterior space you enter.

For outdoor quests, a night time space layout essentially works like a dark room inside.

### Before You Start

Before you get going, be sure to follow these other setup actions.

#### Stamina

Now that the quest is chosen, each player should be dealt 5 cards face down from the Action Deck to fill their Stamina. **Players may NOT look at these cards**! Players can use these cards when they feel they need to excel at a particular action that requires a target to be hit. Think of this pile as the amount of extra energy your character has to perform certain actions – and it can easily run out. You can read about using Stamina cards to attack, defend, and perform other actions in the various sections later in these instructions.

You can receive more Stamina cards in three ways:

1. After exiting any space (room or exterior area), each player may draw one Stamina card.
2. Use an item (or ability if there is one) which allows you to draw a Stamina card.
3. Do nothing on a turn – no attacks, no defending, no aiming, no items... nothing. If you **do nothing**, you can draw one Stamina card.

In all cases, when drawing a Stamina card, the player should draw it from the Action deck and add it to the **bottom** of their Stamina pile, **without looking at it**. Note that you can only have a **maximum of 5 Stamina cards** in your pile, unless you have an ability that says otherwise – do not draw past this, even if something tells you to draw another card.

#### Starting Items

In addition to any items left over in your inventory from previous game sessions, when a party starts out on a quest each player will be given some items to help them out. Quests may specify the items players start with, but often it will be left up to chance. In that case, Each player should **flip two cards** from the Action deck to determine their first starting item. 

Unless the quest says otherwise, players should also receive a healing item. This should be whatever the lowest level healing item is for your scenario. (In other words, not a full HP restore or revive-from-death type of item.)

Each scenario will have its own starting item table, this is just a generic guide:

| Card Sum | Item Type | Example & Notes |
| -------- | --------- | ------- |
| 2-5      | Mildly useful item | torch or other throw away item |
| 6-10     | Reasonably useful item | lock pick maybe |
| 11-15    | Good item | armor or weapon, but not too strong |
| 16-19    | Very useful item | fireball magic or other single use but strong item |
| 20-23    | Rare and useful item | full HP restore maybe |
| 25-26    | Choose anything above | Choose ne from above AND flip for a second item |

#### Equip Some Gear

There are more instructions on equipping gear in the [Chests and Items](07_chests_and_items.md) section, but in general, players should consider equipping some gear as they start each quest.
