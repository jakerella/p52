Room/Space Layout


To begin a new room (or “space” for exterior quests) start by flipping over the top two or three cards of your Room deck (3 cards for 4+ characters) and add the values together. Make sure you have shuffled since the previous room! The sum of the values determines the number of "spots" in the room (each spot is a card and represents a small area of the space). If this is an interior quest, flip another card to determine if the room is lit or not: red means it is lit, black means the room is pitch black. If this is an exterior quest the space is lit during the day and dark at night (be sure to keep track of your day/night cycle).
Now take the Room deck and lay cards from it face down beginning in front of your player pieces; the first card you lay down will be where your characters will start (in other words you may choose where you will enter the room). Lay down as many cards as were determined above – you can configure them in any pattern you like, but they must all be connected (no diagonal connections, and no “islands”). All of the cards should be oriented in the same manner, and should be laid out so the edges all match. In other words, you cannot put a card half way between two other cards. Look at the Example Layouts further down to see what this looks like.
You should rotate who lays out each room, and they get the final say!


Determining the Exit
The exit for any room is determined by first flipping another card from your Room deck: a 2-4 indicates the exit is to the left of the starting side, a 5-7 indicates it is across from the starting side, and a 8-10  indicates it is to the right of the starting side. The actual exit spot (think: where the door is) will be the furthest card away from the starting spot – or furthest to the left of the start if the exit is across from the entrance.
If you flip an Ace the exit is barricaded and you must defeat all enemies in the room before the door/path will open (at which point you may exit that way and proceed as usual). This means you must reveal the entire room before the exit will open.
Note that you may want to mark the entrance and exit in each room, perhaps with coins?


Example Layouts
Here are two possible layouts for reference:
Example 1
Dark room; exit card flip was a 3; player is on 3S
Example 2
All revealed (end of room); exit card flip was a 7





Note that the layout does not need to be symmetrical, but all cards must be connected!


Revealing the Room
If the room/space is lit, characters can see farther into the area. If the room/space is not lit, then it is pitch black, and characters can only see the spots directly around them.
When a player moves to a new spot, (a face down card) then will always be able to see that spot, so you should turn the layout card over to reveal what is there. You can read about how players move in the Player Movement section below.
If the space is lit, then when a new spot is revealed, any spot in that character’s line of sight within 2 spots is also revealed. This includes diagonal spots, but within 2 moves.
If the space is not lit, then when a new spot is revealed, only the spot that character is on and spots one move away are revealed. This does NOT include diagonal spots.

Here are two examples:
Example 1
A lit room; character moves from 7H to 6D
Example 2
A dark room; character moves from 7H to 6D




Note that “blocked” spots stop your line of sight!

Any time a spot is revealed you need to determine what each spot is. Use the Room/Space Layout table below to find the card and then take the appropriate action below:
For enemy spots, turn over the top card from the Enemy deck and place it on the spot. Remember that the enemy may be able to move, so do not replace the card on that spot, but instead place the enemy card on top of the spot. You may want to record the enemy in your Session Log. See the Enemies table for more information.
For multi-enemy spots, use the same directions as above, but flip over multiple enemy cards (they will all start on the same spot).
If you are in danger of running out of enemy cards, place any multi-enemy spots first. If you do run out of enemy cards then there are no more enemies in that room... lucky you!
For item chests you do not need to do anything special, but remember that the chest can only be opened once, thus after the item is retrieved - or destroyed - the spot is simply empty. You may want to mark unopened chests with a coin?
Lastly, note that any spot not taken up by a card (that is, anywhere that you have not placed a card in the layout) is considered impenetrable and visually impairing. In other words, you can't see through those areas and you can't attack through those areas. In the example layouts above the "blocked" area is an example of this. That area is completely blocked, thus any enemy on the "6H" spot cannot attack any player on the "5H" spot - and vice versa, but note that the enemy does know you are there, and will still move to get you. See the Line of Sight section later for more on how and when you can see and attack.

* Any time a player moves onto a spot with a trap, they must flip to avoid the effects (damage). If they flip lower than their target, they take 2 damage (cannot be defended). The target is: 13 - (Balance + Move)
Note that triggering a trap does not disable it. Thus any other players must also perform this check. Enemies are immune to the traps.
** When traveling through an “Obstructed” spot a player or enemy must use 2 movement actions. For players or enemies with a movement of 1, this spot takes two turns.
† When on "Hidden" spots, an enemy can only see you if they are also on the spot (thus no attacks from any range). Ranged attacks made from this spot (by a player or enemy) cannot be countered, but can be defended.
