## Setting Up a Session

Each time you play the game you will need to select a quest and an environment to play in from within your scenario/world. This step is only done once per game session and is done after Character Creation (or first if you are using characters from a previous game session).

> Make sure to record the information about your session in a [Session Log](guides/P52-session-log.pdf)!

### Choose a Quest

The first step to setting up your game session is to choose a quest for your character(s). You can either select one specifically, or you can choose one at random. All quests should have one of the following categories: Big Boss, Survival, Trapped, or Treasure Hunt. If using a random selection, flip a card from the Action deck: A-3 = Big Boss, 4-6 = Survival, 7-9 = Trapped, 10-12 = Treasure Hunt. On a King (13), flip a second action card to determine the quest (using the buckets above) and each character gets to **start the quest with one extra item** (see "Before You Start" below). Note that you can only get one extra item. If the next card is also a king, simply flip another card.

_If not choosing randomly_, you may want to go in this order: (1) Treasure Hunt, (2) Survival, (3) Trapped, (4) Big Boss. There are a limited number of pre-defined quests in each scenario you can embark upon, but you can always make up a new quest idea!

**These are not the quests.** These are the generic descriptions of the four categories that each scenario should implement. While the scenarios may tweak these descriptions and outcomes, they should generally be pretty close.

> Every quest will have a bonus for completing it. Those will always be specified in the specific scenario you are playing through.

| Category      | Description   | Notes |
| ------------- | ------------- | ----- |
| Treasure Hunt | Ooooh, shiny! Remember that special thing the High Leader always asked for? Well, we know it's in a chest around here somewhere. Find it for them! | This is essentially a hunt for a specific treasure chest. Generally an Ace represents a chest. The scenario will tell you **which chest is the right one**. That may be based on a sequence, a number of dungeon rooms, etc. Regardless a strong enemy should always be protecting that chest! There should also be some escape shenanigans, like flipping an Action card to see how many rooms you have to escape through. |
| Trapped       | We're trapped down here! We need to find the hidden keys and escape. | You need to collect some number of keys in order to complete the quest. Keys may be on certain enemies, or in chests, depending on the scenario. There may also be escape conditions, like using a pair of keys in a certain way to unlock the exit. |
| Survival      | There's too many of 'em! We just need to hold out a little longer. | The idea is just to crawl the dungeon and survive. The scenario states how many enemies or rooms there are in some novel fashion. Often players will need to defeat all enemies in a room before progressing. |
| Big Boss      | Uh oh, they look tough. | Generally a scenario will dictate that you need to defeat a minor _and_ a big boss. Often an Ace will represent a Boss in a room layout, with the first to appear being the Minor Boss, the second the Big Boss. The bosses are generally stronger than other enemies and can often heal or move in some unique way. |

For any quest bonuses, the "Level" used is the final character level after all experience outside of the bonus has been applied.

### Choose the Environment

The next step in setting up your playing session is to choose the environment you will be completing this quest in. The scenario should give you some guidance here, and options. However, while there may seem to be a limited number of choices, you should be creative and make a story out of your game! That is the essence of any Role Playing Game (RPG).

In general, each quest will either take place inside or outside. If your scenario specifies where this quest is, then you can use that, but it may also give you two options (one for inside, one for outside). To randomly determine the setting for your quest, flip the top card from the **Room Deck**: red means outside, black means inside.

The difference between interior quests and exterior is generally the lighting conditions, but your scenario may specify other conditions. For interior campaigns each room may be pre-lit or may be dark - and thus you may or may not be able to see the enemies and other things in the room beyond the spot you are on. See the section on "Space Layout" later on to learn how this is decided.

Exterior environments will either be light or dark depending on whether it is day time or night time - and there is a day/night cycle which determines this. At the beginning of the quest you must flip a card from the top of the **Room Deck**: a red card means you will start at day break, a black card will indicate starting at sunset. Each day (or night) lasts for 1 space (one room setup), thus upon entering the second space the day/night cycle flips - that is, if it was day, it becomes night. Repeat this process for each additional exterior space you enter.

For outdoor quests, a night time space layout essentially works like a dark room inside.

### Before You Start

#### Stamina

Now that the session is set up, each player should be dealt 5 cards face down from the Action Deck to fill their Stamina. **Players may NOT look at these cards**! Players can use these cards when they feel they need to excel at a particular action that requires a target to be hit. Think of this pile as the amount of extra energy your character has to perform certain actions – and it can easily run out. You can read about using Stamina cards to attack, defend, and perform other actions in the various sections later in these instructions.

You can receive more Stamina cards in three ways:

1. After exiting any space (room or exterior area), each player may draw one Stamina card.
2. Use an item (or ability if there is one) which allows you to draw a Stamina card.
3. Do nothing on a turn – no attacks, no defending, no aiming, no items... nothing. If you **do nothing**, you can draw one Stamina card.

In all cases, when drawing a Stamina card, the player should draw it from the Action deck and add it to the bottom of their Stamina pile, **without looking at it**. Note that you can only have a **maximum of 5 Stamina cards** in your pile, unless you have an ability that says otherwise – do not draw past this, even if something tells you to draw another card.

#### Starting Items

In addition to any items left over in your inventory from previous game sessions, when a party starts out on a quest each player will be given two items to help them out. Each player should **flip two cards** from the Action deck to determine their first starting item. The second item will always be a healing item. This should be whatever the lowest level healing item is for your scenario. (In other words, not a full HP restore or revive-from-death type of item.)

Each P52 scenario will have its own starting item table, this is just a generic guide.

| Card Sum | Item Type | Example & Notes |
| -------- | --------- | ------- |
| 2-5      | Mildly useful item | torch or other throw away item |
| 6-10     | Reasonably useful item | lock pick maybe |
| 11-15    | Good item | armor or weapon, but not too strong |
| 16-19    | Very useful item | fireball magic or other single use but strong item |
| 20-23    | Rare and useful item | full HP restore maybe |
| 25-26    | Choose anything above | Choose ne from above AND flip for a second item |
