Setting Up a Session

Each time you play the game you will need to select a quest and an environment to play in. This step is only done once per game session and is done after Character Creation (or first if you are using characters from a previous game session).
Choose a Quest
The first step to setting up your game session is to choose a quest for your character(s). You can either select one specifically, or you can choose one at random. If using a random selection, flip a card from the Action deck: A-3 = Big Boss, 4-6 = Survival, 7-9 = Trapped, 10-12 = Treasure Hunt. On a king (13), flip another card to determine the quest and you get to start the quest with one extra item (see Before You Start below). Note that you can only get one extra item, if the next card is also a king, simply flip another card.
There are a limited number of pre-defined quests you can embark upon, but take some time to customize them with a little personal flair! Remember, the idea is to have fun, so make the quest something interesting (versus the somewhat generic terms used below). You can always make up a new quest idea!

Notes
Treasure Hunt
Ooooh, shiny. Remember that special thing the princess always asked for? Well, we know it’s in a chest around here somewhere. Find it for her!
Keep track of how many rooms you go through. An Ace in a room is a special chest and an enemy is always defending it (so draw one for this spot). After successfully opening the chest (just like normal), you must see if your item is in it: draw one card from the Action deck, if the card is 6 or lower this item is a fake and your quest continues (find the next special chest).
Once you find the shiny item, you need to go back through the same number of rooms (minus 1 for the one you are in) to get out! Don’t forget that ONE of you has to survive with the item!
BONUS: After completing, each character receives an Adrenaline Boost item to add to their inventory for use on the next game session and 5 x Level experience.
Trapped
We're trapped, and the only way out is to collect a pair of hidden keys somewhere in the area. When you see a key, grab it and hold on, you'll need it to escape.
You need to collect two keys in order to complete the quest, find a room with an Ace (a key); go to the spot with the Ace to collect it (add it to  your inventory), this is a free action.
Once TWO keys are collected, the next room will be the last room. Both keys are required to exit this room. That is, both keys must be at the exit spot at the same time, if a player with a key dies, another player may collect the key from the spot the dead player is on. You do not need to kill all enemies.
BONUS: After completing, each character receives +3 Levels in Move and 5 x Level experience points.
Survival
There are enemies everywhere, and you have to defeat them all! Hold out as long as you can.
Flip a card from the Room deck to determine number of rooms:
# Rooms = (14 - Flip) / 2     (Rounded down)
For this quest, the exit of each room will be barricaded until all enemies in the room are defeated (and the room is completely revealed).
BONUS: After completing, each character receives +3 Levels in Lift and 5 x Level experience points.
Big Boss
Uh oh, they look tough. You'll need to defeat two bosses (one minor and one major) in order to make it through this ordeal.
An Ace in a room is a Boss, the first to appear is a Minor Boss, the second is the Major Boss. Minor Bosses are simply a regular enemy (Flip from the Enemy deck) with all suit bonuses for that enemy type (see Enemies).
The Major Boss is tough (high HP), uses a ranged attack when farther than away and a melee attack within the same spot. All damage is pretty high. They can also heal, move, and possibly use other abilities. Check your scenario to see what they can do specifically.
When the Major Boss is revealed do not turn over any other enemies (and existing enemies will flee immediately).
You must defeat both Bosses, but you can run from either (when you leave the room they regain full strength). If you run, the next Ace you see is the boss you ran from.
The quest is completed as soon as the Major Boss is defeated (no need to exit the room).
BONUS: After completing, each character gains +1 Level in any attacking ability; +1 Level in any defending or healing ability; and 5 x Level experience points.

In all cases above, the Level used in bonuses is the final character level after all experience outside of the bonus has been applied.
For the Boss Quest, the Level used in attacks is always the Average Player Level.

Choose the Environment
The next step in setting up your playing session is to choose the environment you will be completing this quest in. Again, while there may seem to be a limited number of choices, you should be creative and make a story out of your game. That is the essence of the Role Playing Game (RPG). Each playing session will either take place inside or outside, these are the only two options. Consider personalizing the quest by saying that it takes place in an enemy castle or a river valley.
Your scenario may specify whether the session takes place indoors or outdoors, but if you want to randomize it you can. To randomly determine the setting for your quest, flip the top card from the Room deck: red means outside, black means inside.
The difference between interior quests and exterior is the lighting conditions. For interior campaigns each room may or may not be lit - and thus you may or may not be able to see the enemies and other things in the room beyond the spot you are on. See the section on Room/Space Layout to learn how this is decided.
Exterior environments will either be light or dark depending on whether it is day time or night time - and there is a day/night cycle which determines this. At the beginning of the quest you must flip a card from the top of the Room deck: a red card means you will start at day break, a black card will indicate starting at night. Each day (or night) lasts for 1 space, thus upon entering the second space the day/night cycle flips - that is, if it was day, it becomes night. Repeat this process for each additional exterior space you enter.
Before You Start
Stamina
Now that the session is set up, each player should be dealt 5 cards face down from the Action deck to fill their Stamina – players may NOT look at these cards! Players can use these cards when they feel they need to excel at a particular action that requires a target to be hit. Think of this pile as the amount of extra energy your character has to perform certain actions – and it can easily run out. You can read about using Stamina cards to attack, defend, and perform other actions in the various sections later in this document.
You can receive more Stamina cards in two ways:
After exiting any space (room or exterior area), each player may draw one Stamina card.
Use an item (or ability if there is one) which allows you to draw a Stamina card.
Do nothing on a turn – no attacks, no defending, no aiming, no items... nothing. If you do nothing, you can draw one Stamina card.
In all cases, when drawing a Stamina card, the player should draw it from the Action deck and add it to the bottom of their Stamina pile.
Note that you can only have a maximum of 5 Stamina cards in your pile, unless you have an ability that says otherwise – do not draw past this, even if something tells you to draw another card.

Starting Items
In addition to any items left over in your inventory from the previous game session, when a party starts out on a quest each player will be given two items to help them out. Each player should flip two cards from the Action deck to determine their first starting item. In addition, each player will receive one healing item - this should be whatever the lowest level healing item is (not a full HP restore or revive-from-death potion).
Each P52 scenario will have its own starting item table, this is just a guide for those scenarios.
Card Sum
Item
2-5
Mildly useful item, maybe a torch?
6-10
Reasonably useful item, maybe a lock pick or two?
11-15
Good item, maybe some armor or a weapon?
16-19
Very useful item, maybe something magical?
20-23
Rare and useful item, maybe something to restore a lot of health?
25-26
Player may choose any one of the items above, then draws again for another item.
Note that this only works once, stop at three items total!


You can read about these and other items in the Chest Items table within the scenario.
