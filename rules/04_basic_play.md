## Basic Play

This section is intended to give you an overview of the flow of a game session. We assume you've already familiarized yourself with the [general mechanics](01_general_mechanics.md) of the game, [created your character(s)](02_creating_a_character.md), and [set up a game session](03_setting_up_a_session.md).

Each game session is a quest, and each quest is broken up into various "spaces", which may be rooms in castle, dungeon tunnels, or forest paths, depending on your quest and the scenario. Within each space you will likely need to defeat enemies, collect items from chests, and possibly find a special thing, person, or enemy. The quest should lay these things out for you.

In general, a game session will go like this:

0. [Session setup](03_setting_up_a_session.md) (1 time)
    - Choose a scenario and a quest within it
    - Determine the environment (inside vs outside)
    - Deal stamina
    - Determine starting items
1. Shuffle the Room and Enemy decks (separately)
2. Lay out the space using the Room deck
    - Determine space size
    - Lay out spots (cards) face down
    - Flip a card to determine the exit location and any specifics
    - Determine if room is lit (or track day/night cycle) and reveal appropriate room spots
3. Characters enter the room on the starting spot
    - Players all start on first card laid down in step 2
    - If any enemies are visible, determine initiative
5. Following initiative order, players and enemies take their turns
    - Players can move, attack, defend, aim, and open chests
    - Enemies will move, attack, defend, and heal in predictable ways, according to the scenario
    - Initiative will change any time a new enemy is revealed
6. Characters exit the room and determine experience (and level up if necessary)
    - Once ALL players are on the exit (and it is open), players may exit the room
    - Assign experience according to the actions taken in the space (possibly leveling up)
7. If your quest is not yet complete, return to step 1

The playing session ends either when your quest has been completed or all party members (characters) are defeated. After finishing a quest, you should sort out any remaining experience or bonuses from the quest and do any necessary leveling up.

### Using a Session Log

When you start a new game session you may want to consider using a [session log](guides/P52-session-log.pdf) to track what happens - especially things like enemies defeated and chests opened. There is a blank [Session Log](guides/P52-session-log.pdf) that you can use, or create your own with all of the information you need. The idea is to track the quest being undertaken, the location, the players, and what happens. Most often this means what enemies you encounter and how they are dealt with. Doing this will help when assessing experience points after each room (and at the end of the session).
