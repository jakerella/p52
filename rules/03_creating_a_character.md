## Creating a Character

> Use should use a [Character Sheet](guides/P52-character-sheet.pdf) to track your stats!

As with most Role Playing Games (RPGs), you will be creating the character that you play with. This character will be unique to you, and will "live on" past the end of any one game session - that is, you will use this same character each time you play, improving their skills and building them up. Of course, you can always create a new character and start over, or play as more than one!

> If you already have a character from a previous session - and **in the same reality** - then you can use that character again, and continue to level them up. Of course, you can always choose to create a new character.

When creating your character you should know that the actions your character takes in the game are based almost entirely on "Abilities" which you gain through this creation process (and through Leveling Up during the course of the game). You should refer to the Abilities table later in this document when creating your character so that you can make informed decisions.

These instructions are the basic rules and mechanics. The actual races, classes, abilities, etc. you can choose from will be in the specific scenario/reality that you choose!

### Character Basics

Each character has basic qualities like a name, race, and class. They will typically also have a quirk that makes them unique and special. There are 5 "core abilities" that every character has:

* Lift: your ability to lift things, and generally a measure of how strong you are
* Think: your ability to logically reason through problems, and generally a measure of how smart you are
* Balance: your ability to maintain your balance, even in tough situations
* Move: your ability to move yourself, and generally a measure of your speed
* Lead: your ability to convince others to do what you want, and partially a measure of your charisma

These core abilities also determine certain other attributes of your character:

* Movement: how many spots you can move on a normal turn
* Max HP: your maximum health (hit points)
* Initiative: how willing you are to go first into the breach

These abilities and attributes are the same for every character (except for the quirks), but the levels of them allow characters to attain and build up additional abilities: things like knife or bow skills, magic or spiritualism, or even things like incredible feats of acrobatics. These additional abilities may be obtained over time, and are generally **specific to each scenario** as they relate to the reality your characters live in.

> **All core abilities start at 1 point.** The instructions below describe _modifiers_ to your base values.

### Step 1: Choose a Race

Each race will have certain abilities that they are better at, and some that they are not so good at. There may also be special abilities available only to certain races. You will want to choose your race keeping in mind what type of character you want to be (for example, a strong warrior versus a powerful wizard). Check out the "Race Modifiers" table in your scenario document to see all of the options.

Your race may grant you some additional abilities, be sure to add those to your [character sheet](guides/P52-character-sheet.pdf)! Note that the ability prerequisites do not apply to abilities gained automatically from your race!

### Step 2: Choose a Class

Your class indicates what focus your character has taken in life. Have they studied the martial arts, or focused on magic? Are they athletic? Are they a leader? Choosing your class will help define what abilities you are good at (similar to your race). 
See the "Class Modifiers" table in your scenario to see all of the options.

Your class may grant you some additional abilities, be sure to add those to your [character sheet](guides/P52-character-sheet.pdf)! Note that the ability prerequisites do not apply to abilities gained automatically from your class!

### Step 3: Draw for Ability Bonuses

Now that you have your base character, we need to determine how good they are in certain abilities. This step adds some uniqueness - and randomness - to your character's core abilities, and can give you a big boost in certain areas. For your character, flip over the top 3 Action cards, look at the three values and find the one in the middle, this is how many points you get to add to your **core abilities** (and only core abilities). You can split these points in any way you like, adding some to each core ability or putting them all in one ability.

For example, you might flip over a 2, a 5, and a 6. You get to add 5 points to your core abilities, any way you choose. If you draw two cards that are the same (and one different), then the value you get is the duplicated one (so a 3 a 6 and 6 gets you 6 points).

> If you draw **three cards that are the same**, then lucky you, you get that value **plus 2**!

### Step 4: Add up Core Ability Points

> All core abilities start at 1 point.

After selecting your race and class, and determining your bonus, you can determine your starting values for all Core abilities (Lift, Think, Balance, Move, and Lead) by adding or subtracting the values from the modifier tables based on your race and class. You may have some abilities that have a negative value, but you should change all of these to 1 after you finish tallying things up. In other words, **the minimum value for any core ability is one (1)**.

> For example, Jane chooses a race with modifiers of +1, -2, +1, +1, 0 for Lift, Think, Balance, Move, and Lead respectively. Her class modifiers are 0, 0, +2, +1, -1 for the same core abilities. She flips a 9, 3, and 6 for her bonus and thus gets 6 bonus points to add anywhere she likes and she chooses to distribute them this way: Lift: +2, Balance +2, Move +2.
> 
> So, when you start each ability at 1, and combine all of the modifiers, you get this:
> 
> Lift: 1 + 1 + 0 + 2 = **4**
> Think: 1 - 2 + 0 + 0 = **-1 => 1** (minimum is 1)
> Balance: 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = **6**
> Move: 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = **5**
> Lead: 1 + 0 - 1 + 0 = **0 => 1** (minimum is 1)

### Step 5: Choose a Quirk

This step is sort of optional, but highly recommended!

Quirks allow you a lot of freedom: develop a short backstory for your character - where did they come from? Why are they here? Then think of some quirk that they have, maybe they are terrified of the dark, or have a peg leg. Perhaps they were raised by wolves. You can go completely wild here.

> You should consider writing down some of your story for future plays with the same character.

In any case, once you have thought of their quirk, you need to **work it into the game mechanics**. Your scenario should provide some example quirk effects that fit into that reality, but you should feel free to create your own. Be creative and think about how your character would really behave. For example, your quirk could be that you are the friendliest person around. The penalty could be that you must approach each enemy to discuss things before being willing to attack them. The bonus for that quirk may be that your character gets a `-3` target for any defensive ability while adjacent to an enemy.

Some quirks may be ongoing (like the defensive bonus discussed above), or they may be once-per-quest use. For example, having a magic bag that you can pull an item out of just in time. You will need to specify that on your [character sheet](guides/P52-character-sheet.pdf) and make sure you track any that are limited in their use.

> Note that any quirk must have both **a bonus AND a penalty** that fit within the game mechanics!

### Step 6: Add a non-Core Ability

In addition to any additional (non-core) abilities you gain from your race or class, each player may then pick one additional ability for their character. These must come from the Abilities table in your scenario, and note that you **must meet the prerequisites** for any ability gained at this step (and generally for any other gained abilities).

You will start at level 1 for this ability. Make sure to record it on your [character sheet](guides/P52-character-sheet.pdf)!

### Step 7: Determine Other Attributes

At this point you are ready to calculate your character's maximum Hit Points (max HP), their starting Movement speed, and your characters initiative (you'll see how to use these values later). To do so, simple use the following formulas, replacing the ability names with their level:

```
Max HP = Lift x Think + 3
Movement = (Move / 4) + 1
Initiative = Move + (Lead x 2)
```

**Don't forget to give your character a name!**
