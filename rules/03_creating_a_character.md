## Creating a Character

> Use should use a [Character Sheet](guides/P52-character-sheet.pdf) to track your stats!

As with most Role Playing Games (RPGs), you will be creating the character that you play with. This character will be unique to you, and will "live on" past the end of any one game session - that is, you will use this same character each time you play, improving their skills and building them up. Of course, you can always create a new character and start over, or play as more than one!

> If you already have a character from a previous session - and **in the same reality** - then you can use that character again, and continue to level them up. Of course, you can always choose to create a new character.

When creating your character you should know that the actions your character takes in the game are based almost entirely on "Abilities" which you gain through this creation process (and through Leveling Up during the course of the game). You should refer to the Abilities table later in this document when creating your character so that you can make informed decisions.

These instructions are the basic rules and mechanics. The actual races, classes, abilities, etc. you can choose from will be in the specific scenario/reality that you choose!

### Character Basics

Each character has basic qualities like a name, race, and class. They will typically also have a quirk that makes them unique and special. There are 5 "core abilities" that every character has:

* Lift: your ability to lift things, and generally a measure of how strong you are
* Think: your ability to logically reason through problems, and generally a measure of how smart you are
* Balance: your ability to maintain your balance, even in tough situations
* Move: your ability to move yourself, and generally a measure of your speed
* Lead: your ability to convince others to do what you want, and partially a measure of your charisma

These core abilities also determine certain other attributes of your character:

* Movement: how many spots you can move on a normal turn
* Max HP: your maximum health (hit points)
* Initiative: how willing you are to go first into the breach

These abilities and attributes are the same for every character (except for the quirks), but the levels of them allow characters to attain and build up additional abilities: things like knife or bow skills, magic or spiritualism, or even things like incredible feats of acrobatics. These additional abilities may be obtained over time, and are generally **specific to each scenario** as they relate to the reality your characters live in.

### Step 1: Choose a Race

Each race will have certain abilities that they are better at, and some that they are not so good at. There may also be special abilities available only to certain races. You will want to choose your race keeping in mind what type of character you want to be (for example, a strong warrior versus a powerful wizard). Check out the "Race Core Ability Levels" table in your scenario document to see all of the options.

Your race may grant you some additional abilities, be sure to add those to your [character sheet](guides/P52-character-sheet.pdf)! Note that the ability prerequisites do not apply to abilities gained automatically from your race!

### Step 2: Choose a Class

Your class indicates what focus your character has taken in life. Have they studied the martial arts, or focused on magic? Are they athletic? Are they a leader? Choosing your class will help define what abilities you are good at (similar to your race). 
See the "Class Core Ability Levels" table in your scenario to see all of the options.

Your class may grant you some additional abilities, be sure to add those to your [character sheet](guides/P52-character-sheet.pdf)! Note that the ability prerequisites do not apply to abilities gained automatically from your class!

### Step 3: Add up Core Ability Points

All core abilities start at 1 point.

After selecting your race and class you can determine your starting values for all Core abilities (Lift, Think, Balance, Move, and Lead). Add or subtract the values based on your race and class as described in the scenario tables. You may have some abilities that have a negative value, but you should change all of these to one after you finish tallying things up. In other words, **the minimum value for any ability is one** (1).

### Step 4: Choose a Quirk

This step is sort of optional, but highly recommended!

Quirks allow you a lot of freedom: develop a short backstory for your character - where did they come from? Why are they here? Then think of some quirk that they have, maybe they are terrified of the dark, or have a peg leg. Perhaps they were raised by wolves. You can go completely wild here.

> You should consider writing down some of your story for future plays with the same character.

In any case, once you have thought of their quirk, you need to **work it into the game mechanics**. There is a table later in this document of some Example Quirk Effects that you can use, but it's more likely that you will want to create your own. Be creative and think about how your character would really behave. For example, the penalty for a quirk could be that your character is extremely friendly (or naive) and must approach each enemy before they are willing to attack them. The bonus for that quirk may be that your character gets a -3 target for any defensive ability while adjacent to an enemy.

Some quirks may be ongoing (like the defensive bonus discussed above), or they may be single-use. You will need to specify that on your [character sheet](guides/P52-character-sheet.pdf) and make sure you track any that are limited in their use.

> Note that any quirk must have both **a bonus AND a penalty** that fit within the game mechanics!

### Step 5: Draw for Ability Bonuses

Now that you have your base character, we need to determine how good they are in certain abilities. This step adds some uniqueness - and randomness - to your character's abilities, and can give you a big boost in certain areas. For each character, flip over the top 3 Action cards, look at the three values and find the one in the middle, this is how many points you get to add to your **core abilities** (and only core abilities). You can split these points in any way you like, adding some to each core ability or putting them all in one ability.

For example, you might flip over a 2, a 5, and a 6. You get to add 5 points to your core abilities, any way you choose.

If you draw two cards that are the same (and one different), then the value you get is the duplicated one (so a 3 a 6 and 6 gets you 6 points).

If you draw **three cards that are the same**, then lucky you, you get that value **plus 2**!

### Step 6: Add an Ability

In addition to any abilities you gain from your race or class, each player may then pick one additional ability for their character. These must come from the Abilities table in your scenario, and note that you **must meet the prerequisites** for any ability gained at this step (and generally for any other gained abilities).

### Step 7: Determine Other Attributes

At this point you are ready to calculate your characters maximum Hit Points (max HP), their starting Movement speed, and your characters initiative (you'll see how to use these values later). To do so, simple use the following formulas, replacing the ability names with their level:

```
Max HP = [Lift] x [Think] + 3
Movement = ([Move] / 4) + 1
Initiative = [Move] + ([Lead] x 2)
```

**Don't forget to give your character a name!**
