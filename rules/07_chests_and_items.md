## Chests and Items

Players can get items in a few different ways:

* At the start of a quest
* By opening chests
* From enemy drops
* Via trades with other players
* At the end of quest as a reward
* Or possibly from some scenario-specific ability

### Opening Chests

Opening a chest is the most straight forward way to get an item in the middle of a quest. Attempting to open a chest takes a full turn - even if the attempt is unsuccessful. A chest can be opened in three ways: **lock picking**, **breaking it open**, or a key (although this is scenario-specific).

To open a chest using the Lock Picking ability, move to the spot with the chest and then take a turn to open it by flipping a card from the Action deck. You will need to meet or exceed your target for the ability (similar to attacking) in order to succeed.

Flipping an Ace results in a **broken lock**, regardless of your level in the ability. When a lock is broken, the chest can only be opened by attacking it (see below). You may attempt to open a chest as many times as you wish, but keep in mind that it takes a full turn each time.

If you flip a King, the chest contains **two items**. Determine what they are individually, but in the same manner described below.

### Untrained Lock Picking

If a player is not trained in the Lock Picking ability, they can still use this method using a **Lock Pick item**. Attempting to open a chest with a Lock Pick item consumes the lock pick if you _fail_, thus after the attempt - if unsuccessful - remove the item from your inventory. For this method, each lock pick item you use allows you to use a higher level in the Lock Pick ability. In other words, using a single pick is like having level 1 Lock Picking. Using two pick items is like having level 2 in the ability (1 + 1). You **cannot get above level 3** using this method.

> If you are already trained in the Lock Pick ability, using a lock pick item adds +2 to your attempt.

### Revealing the Item

Once a chest is open, you flip two cards from the Action deck and use the card total to determine what item you get. Each scenario will have its own "Chest Items" table. Place any item received in your character's inventory. Note that you do not have to take the item, and if you do not it remains on that spot. There is no limit to the number of items you can hold, unless your scenario or quest says otherwise.

> If both of the cards are the **same suit** in your flips to reveal the item, then you also gain 1 Lock Pick item.

### Attacking a Chest

If the lock on a chest has been broken - or if you simply choose not to use the Lock Picking ability or a Lock Pick item - you may attack the chest in order to open it. Flip a card from the Action deck, then add that value to: `(Think / 3)`. A **10 or greater** value opens the chest, a **4 or less** destroys the chest and any item in it. A King will still reveal a chest with two items in it. On a flip of an Ace, the chest explodes and you take `(2 x avgLv)` HP of damage.

> You may use Stamina to increase your flip value when attacking a chest!

### Equipping (and Unequipping) Items

On your turn you can choose to equip (or remove) an item that is not consumable, like a piece of armor or a weapon (but not a potion). This is a free action, and you can equip as many items as you want, but you may only do it once. In other words, you may _not_ equip, move, then equip again in the same turn (but you could move and then equip an item).

Note that **only equipped items** grant the player their bonus! In other words, the defensive bonus of a helmet is only applied if it is equipped. You cannot have more than one item equipped on the same body part, and you should be sensible about other items. For example, you may be able to have a sword and a knife equipped, but certainly not a sword and a mace. Consider equipping what you would be holding in your hands or easily accessible (like a knife), not what is in your satchel.

You may choose to unequip an item you have previously equipped using this same process (note that you would do this in the same free action, you still can't equip or unequip twice in one turn). Any removed item goes back into your inventory.
