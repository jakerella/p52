General Mechanics

Since the focus of this game is to be able to be played with just 2 decks of cards, pencil and paper, and a placeholder for your character(s) there are some changes to traditional game mechanics. For example, instead of using dice - as many RPGs do - the game uses an Action Deck of all 52 cards which will be flipped – we'll refer to this simply as “Flipping” in many places in the instructions (although if you wish to use D13 dice, go ahead, but that will change the odds). For non-player characters (NPCs) most actions will be decided by the characters attributes and/or Flipping.
This game is intended for 2 to 6 players, but it could easily be played solo (or by one person playing as multiple characters) - or by 7 or 8 people (although you may need a third deck).
Setting Up the Decks
In order to set up the decks to play, choose a deck and remove all face cards from it, putting them in a separate pile; this side pile of face cards will be your Enemy Deck. The remainder of the numbered cards from this first deck will be your Room Deck. The other (still complete) deck of cards will be your Action Deck. So to recap, you should have three decks: a 12-card “Enemy” deck with just face cards, a 40-card “Room” deck (no face cards), and a 52-card “Action” deck.

Shuffling
For the most part these instructions will tell you when to shuffle, but here are those times: shuffle all decks at the start of a game session. Shuffle both the Enemy and Room decks before laying out any room (and in between rooms). Shuffle the Action deck when it gets low (about ¼ remaining is a good point).

Card Values
In general, card values for each deck will be the amount shown on the card. Of course, for face cards and Aces this changes. Aces always have a value of 1. Face cards have no specific value in the Enemy deck (see the Enemies table later in this document), but in the Action deck they will typically have values of 11 for Jacks, 12 for Queens, and 13 for Kings – any deviations will be pointed out.

Mathematical Equations
Any time you are required to calculate something and you come up with a fraction, you always round down, no matter what the case may be. For example, the calculation for how many spots a character can move is the Ability Level (aLv) for Move divided by 4 plus one. If your level for Move was 7, this calculation would be:
Movement = (7 / 4) + 1 = 2.75
...which would be rounded down to 2.
