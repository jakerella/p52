## General Mechanics

Since the focus of this role playing game is to be able to be played with just 2 decks of cards, pencil and paper, and a placeholder for your character(s) there are some changes to traditional game mechanics. For example, instead of using dice - as many RPGs do - the game uses an "**Action Deck**" of 52 cards which will be flipped (versus rolling dice) – we'll refer to this simply as "Flipping" in many places in the instructions. For non-player characters (NPCs) most actions will be decided by the characters attributes and/or Flipping.


### Setting Up the Decks

In order to set up the decks to play, choose one of the decks and remove all face cards from it, putting them in a separate pile; this side pile of face cards will be your **Enemy Deck**. The remainder of the numbered cards from this first deck will be your **Room Deck**. The other deck of cards will be your **Action Deck**. So to recap, you should have three decks: a 12-card Enemy Deck with just face cards, a 40-card Room Deck (no face cards), and a 52-card Action Deck.

### Shuffling

For the most part these instructions will tell you when to shuffle, but here are those times:

* Shuffle all 3 decks at the start of any game session.
* Shuffle both the Enemy and Room decks before laying out any room (and in between rooms).
* Shuffle the Action deck when it gets low (about 1/4 remaining).

### Card Values

In general, card values for each deck will be the number shown on the card. Of course, for face cards and Aces this changes. **Aces always have a value of 1**. Face cards have no specific value in the Enemy Deck (see the "Enemies Table" later on), but in the Action Deck they will typically have values of **11 for Jacks, 12 for Queens, and 13 for Kings** – any deviations will be pointed out later on.

### Mathematical Equations

Any time you are required to calculate something and you come up with a fraction, you always round down, no matter what the case may be. For example, the calculation for how many spots a character can move is the Ability Level (aLv) for Move divided by 4 plus one. If your level for Move was 7, this calculation would be:

```Movement = (7 / 4) + 1 = 2.75```

...which would be rounded down to 2.
