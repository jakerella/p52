## Finishing Your Quest

The information on how to accomplish each quest is found within the quest itself, but it is important to remember to dole out experience points and do any required Leveling Up after you complete your quest. All players will have their maximum Hit Points (HP) restored prior to the next session of play.

Once all of that is finished, your session is complete! All players should keep their [character sheets](guides/P52-character-sheet.pdf) for the next time you play. Remember, you are building a character over time!

> Note that characters do retain all items in their inventory for the next session of play!

### Failing Your Quest

If all players die during your quest, you will have failed. You will not receive any experience for the current space, nor any experience from completing the quest. The game session will end there. Players may decide to bring back their characters back to life for future sessions though!

#### Resurrection

If any characters have died during the game session the group may decide if they wish to resurrect the character or start a new one the next time they play. Resurrecting a character is simply a matter of restoring their HP to its maximum, but they will still lose all items in their inventory, whether equipped or not.
