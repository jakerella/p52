        description: [
            'The land of Mioweth in the realm of Animalia has been at peace for over two hundred years. Their people are simple, but practical folk, living in mostly stone dwellings and primarily focused on agriculture. They have been trading more and more with outside groups, but they still produce most of their own food and clothing. Of course, with trade comes interaction with other peoples, and other skills.',
            'Mioweth has recently seen numerous attacks in the outlying villages by terrible beasts, especially the villages in the foothills of the Lichanden mountains. The mountains have long been seen as a possible source of evil, with stories going back hundreds of years. Not too long ago, sentries in the forests observed a strange glow emanating from caves up the mountain side.',
            'Fearing for her people, the Queen of Mioweth, Katya, sent a contingent of soldiers to investigate. They were never heard from again! Now, her forces fear any excursion that even comes close to the mountain. But something must be done!',
            'After returning from a voyage to distant Wufanthia, you and your mates decided to rest up at the inn above the tavern in Tabantha, one of the small outlying villages. It was in this tavern that you were approached by a strange woman, shrouding her identity with a heavy cloak and partial mask. As soon as she approached your table, everyone else in the tavern seemed to move much more slowly, and completely ignored her presence.',
            '"Why the mask?" You ask her casually. "Were you horribly scarred or something?"',
            '"No," she answers, "I just find them terribly comfortable. I think everyone will be wearing them soon. But that\'s not why I\'m here."'
