<p>
    P52 is a self-guided role playing game (RPG) system that only uses two standard playing card decks 
    (52 cards, no jokers) to play. (Okay, technically, you will also need a surface to play, 
    something to mark your player pieces (coins, stones, figurines, whatever), and this 
    companion app or the printed ruleset).

    <p class='no-character'>
        It looks like you have a game scenario already loaded, but there's no character created. Before you 
        can use the companion app to play, you will need to <a href='/create-character'>create your character</a>.
    </p>

    <p class='scenario-and-character'>
        It looks like you already have a game scenario loaded and a character created! 
        Head over to the <a href='/quest'>Quest</a> page to play, or you can review your 
        <a href='/character'>Character Sheet</a>.

        The first step to playing is to 
        <a href='https://github.com/jakerella/p52/blob/main/rules/00_introduction.md'>read the rules</a>, 
        especially the general mechanics. This companion app can walk you through creating your character, 
        and even the big story elements of your quest, but you need to know how to move, attack, defend, and loot!
    </p>

    <p>
        Once you've read the rules, you'll need to <a href='/load-scenario'>choose a scenario</a> here in 
        the app. The companion app will tailor itself to your chosen scenario, so this is an important step! 
        Of course, you can also create your own scenario and use the rules to run your adventure, but in 
        that case you may not be able to use the companion app.
    </p>

    <p>
        Finally, now that you have chosen a scenario, you will need to 
        <a href='/create-character'>create your character</a> (and so will anyone else that is playing). 
        The app will walk you through the steps! Once the whole party has their characters created, you 
        can start the first quest in the scenario.
