# P52

Rules and companion app for the P52 RPG system.

## Basic System Rules

You can find the basic rules for this system in the `/rules` directory. I suggest starting with the [Introduction](rules/0_introduction.md)!


> **WARNING** I converted the rules from a LibreOffice document. They have not yet been properly (re)formatted.
