# P52

P52 is a role playing game (RPG) system that only uses two standard playing card decks (52 cards, no jokers). Technically, you will also need a surface to play on and some paper and pencils, and something to mark your player pieces with (coins, stones, figurines, whatever).

The idea was to create a robust, self-DM'ing, travel-friendly RPG. This repository contains the basic rules as well as pre-defined scenarios and quests. While these instructions may seem long for players new to RPG systems, they are significantly shorter than the instructions for most RPGs, some of which comprise multiple 100+ page volumes.

Many of the ideas in this game are intentionally generic to allow for expansion and alteration. In fact, this manual is published under a [Creative Commons license](LICENSE) so that anyone can copy and modify the rules to fit their needs. All I ask is that you share it with others (and give credit to those that came before you).


## Basic System Rules

In the `/rules` directory you will find a full overview of the base RPG system. You should start with the [Introduction](rules/00_introduction.md) and [General Mechanics](rules/01_general_mechanics.md).


## Scenarios and Quests

While the base system discusses the mechanics of playing, a "scenario" will describe the world you are playing in. It will also define the specific quests you can choose (and perhaps a specific order to play in). Of course, you can always make up your own scenarios and quests!

There is currently only 1 scenario (with 4 quests) in this repository, but more will be added! If you write one, please consider [submitting a Pull Request](pulls) to add it here!
