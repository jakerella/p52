Trapped

The Queen has been impressed with your party’s ability to get things done. She has asked you to go in search of the crazy wizard in the mines. Soon after you enter them, the entrance collapses trapping you inside! Not to worry though, there is another exit, but it appears that all of the doors are locked.

Find a way out and report back to the Queen.
