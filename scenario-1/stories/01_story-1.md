The Queen has asked your party to find the Scarlet Amulet of Nordoon. It is foretold that whomever possesses it will be unstoppable in their magic prowess. She is concerned that the old wizard in the mountains will find it first. There have been reports of his mental instability. Bring the amulet back to her for safe keeping.
