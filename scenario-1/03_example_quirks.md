Magical Touretteâ€™s Syndrome
Any turn you don't attack (when enemies are present), flip a card: on 4 or less you cast Fire Magic uncontrollably. If the card is red, it targets you, if black it targets the nearest, weakest enemy.
Flip another card for the attack on the target as normal. If you are not trained in Fire Magic, assume a level of 1 in the ability.
If on your first flip (to determine if the effect happens) you flip a King, you get a free Fire Magic attack on a target of your choice.
