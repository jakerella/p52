Specific Item Usage
Armor can be worn by anyone, and multiple armor pieces can be worn up to a maximum of 4 (head, body, arms, legs). The effects of any (and all) armor is cumulative, so if you are wearing Decent head armor and Decent leg armor, and your Level is 4, then you have -8 Damage protection (and -1 to your Movement). This means that if you are attacked and hit for damage of 20, then you only lose 12 hit points.
	Note that if your movement is 0 or less by wearing armor then you will not be able to move!
Potions are consumed when used and must be discarded from your inventory after use.
Phoenix Blood and Phoenix Feather will only work on players in the room, thus you cannot bring a dead party member back to life once you leave them behind in a room.
The Winged Shoes are a special item which allows all the wearer to move and take another action in the same turn (in any order), but they cannot split this up. For example, after equipping this item, a player with a movement of 3 could move one spot and then attack an enemy, but they may not then move another two spots.
The Invisibility Cloak can only be used once per room (but it does not need to be equipped) and lasts for 3 rounds – a round includes one full cycle of turns. Using the cloak consumes this turn, and you become invisible until the end of your turn 3 turns later. This includes all other player and enemy turns in between. In other words, think of the 3 rounds you're invisible as being end-capped by the turn you put on the cloak, and the turn it stops working. After the player’s fourth turn after using the cloak, its effect will wear off. After this it remains in your inventory, but unequipped.
While the cloak is equipped (during the three rounds) enemies cannot see you (and thus cannot attack). This includes enemies that would otherwise attempt a passing attack as you move through their spot. The player can attack while cloaked, this does not alter the enemies perception, and they still cannot attack you, including counter attacks! However, enemies can still defend themselves once attacked by the invisible player.
